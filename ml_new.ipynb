By simply adding aromatic aldehydes to diaminobenzene derivatives and allowing the stoichiometric reaction at room temperature under reduced pressure at 66.6 Pa, the dehydrogenation leads to benzimidazoles with the yield as high as 80–90%. In addition, the purging of H2 gas to benzimidazoles results in the hydrogenation of imidazole to obtain the intermediate benzimidazolidine form. This confirms how the cyclization relies on the reduced pressure. This synthesis pathway not only gives the aromatic aldehydes with high yield under the mild condition but also the selection of benzaldehydes with reactive functional groups leads to the precursors for other chemical modifications and polymerizations.', '© 2018 Elsevier B.V.In this present work, a novel electrochemical immunosensor employing a screen-printed graphene electrode (SPGE) for a simple and highly sensitive determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) in a sandwich-type format was proposed. The sensor comprised of two CRP-specific antibodies: an unlabeled capture primary antibody (Anti-1°Ab) and an electrochemically detectable anthraquinone-labeled signaling secondary (AQ-2°Ab) antibody. The Anti-1°Ab was first covalently anchored onto an L-cysteine/gold-modified disposable SPGE (L-Cys/Au/SPGE) to create the anti-CRP surface. After binding of the CRP and the AQ-2°Ab, the electrochemical signal response was measured using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). In the presence of CRP, the sensor exhibited a significant increase in the AQ current at AQ-2°Ab compared to the negative control. The CRP concentration was detected in the range of 0.01–150 µg/mL, and the limit of detection (LOD) (S/N = 3) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) (10 SD/Slope) were 1.5 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL, respectively. This sensor exhibited very high sensitivity in determining CRP and was successfully applied to detect CRP in certified human serum with satisfactory results. The developed sensor is suitable as an alternative method for determination of CRP and the same principle may be further applied to determine other clinically important target molecules.', '© 2017 American Chemical Society.Salmonella causes over a million foodborne illnesses per year in the United States resulting in more hospitalizations and deaths than any other foodborne bacterial pathogen. To help prevent outbreaks, a rapid, portable, sensitive, and reliable method for onsite detection of bacteria that can be used in different sample matrices would be beneficial. Herein, we present a colorimetric paper-based analytical device (PAD) combined with immunomagnetic separation (IMS) for detecting Salmonella typhimurium. IMS anti-Salmonella coated magnetic beads were applied to capture and separate bacteria from the sample matrix and preconcentrate it into small volumes before testing on paper. To directly detect S. typhimurium after IMS, a sandwich immunoassay was implemented into the procedure with β-galactosidase (β-gal) as the detection enzyme. Using the antibody/enzyme complex, we performed a colorimetric assay with chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG) for bacteria quantification. The method was confirmed to be highly specific to S. typhimurium without interference from other pathogenic bacteria like Escherichia coli. Using this system, the limit of detection of S. typhimurium was found to be 102 CFU mL-1 in culturing solution without any pre-enrichment. In addition, distance-based detection where the concentration is read as the length of colored band formed on the reaction was also demonstrated. This assay had a detection limit of 102 CFU mL-1 for S. typhimurium, providing an instrument-free quantitative analysis alternative to spot tests, which require image analysis. Finally, the proposed platform was applied for detection of S. typhimurium in inoculated Starling bird fecal samples and whole milk with detection limits of 105 CFU g-1 and 103 CFU mL-1, respectively, and this is the first published paper-based detection method for S. typhimurium in bird feces and whole milk.', '© 2018 Elsevier B.V.A novel concept for automation of nanostructured hollow-fiber supported microextraction, combining the principles of liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) and sorbent microextraction synergically, using mesofluidic platforms is proposed herein for the first time, and demonstrated with the determination of acidic drugs (namely, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, diclofenac and naproxen) in urine as a proof-of-concept applicability. Dispersed carbon nanofibers (CNF) are immobilized in the pores of a single-stranded polypropylene hollow fiber (CNF@HF) membrane, which is thereafter accommodated in a stereolithographic 3D-printed extraction chamber without glued components for ease of assembly. The analytical method involves continuous-flow extraction of the acidic drugs from a flowing stream donor (pH 1.7) into an alkaline stagnant acceptor (20 mmol L−1 NaOH) containing 10% MeOH (v/v) across a dihexyl ether impregnated CNF@HF membrane. The flow setup features entire automation of the microextraction process including regeneration of the organic film and on-line injection of the analyte-laden acceptor phase after downstream neutralization into a liquid chromatograph (LC) for reversed-phase core-shell column-based separation. Using a 12-cm long CNF@HF and a sample volume of 6.4 mL, linear dynamic ranges of ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen, taken as models of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, spanned from ca. 5–15 µg L−1 to 500 µg L−1 with enhancement factors of 43–97 (against a direct injection of 10 µL standards into LC), and limits of detection from 1.6 to 4.3 µg L−1. Relative recoveries in real urine samples ranged from 97% to 105%, thus demonstrating the reliability of the automatic CNF@HF-LPME method for in-line matrix clean-up and determination of drugs in urine at therapeutically relevant concentrations.', '© 2017 Elsevier B.V.Simple and selective paper-based colorimetric sensors using silver nanoprism (AgNPrs) were conveniently fabricated and developed for the determination of chloride ions (Cl−) contaminated in the environment. Samples containing different concentrations of Cl− were analyzed. The analysis is based on the oxidative etching of the AgNPrs into smaller silver nanospheres (AgNPss) by Cl−. In the presence of Cl−, the distinctive color change of the AgNPrs from dark-violet to red was rapidly visualized by the naked eye in 5 min without the requirement of surface modification. For quantitative measurement using image processing, a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.996) between logarithmic of Cl− concentration and the average mean color intensity was obtained in the range of 10–1000 mg L−1 with a detection limit of 1.3 mg L−1. The developed sensors were investigated for precision, accuracy, and sensitivity and validated by the classical method. Statistical analysis proved that the developed sensors were precise, sensitive and accurate and can be used effectively for the analysis of Cl− in natural waters.', '© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimFour new derivatives of 8-aminoquinolines are successfully synthesized by extension of the -conjugated system on the quinoline ring and incorporation of either the salicylaldimine or its reduced amino form. These compounds show selective fluorescence enhancement by Zn2+ ion, attributing to the chelation-enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) effects, in which the deprotonation of the amido –NH and phenolic -OH causes the internal charge transfer (ICT) process. The fluorescent signals of these compounds are shifted from the range of 391–562 nm to 535–590 nm upon addition of Zn2+. The sensing mechanism is investigated by 1H NMR titration, mass spectrometry, and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis which suggests a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between the sensor and Zn2+. The detection limits of 0.024 to 0.431 μM and the association constants ranging between 7.0 × 103 and 1.2 × 104 M−1 can be estimated for these four sensors. One of these compounds is fabricated on wax-patterned filter paper and used as a probe for Zn2+ in aqueous solution with a naked-eye detection limit at 10 μM.', '© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.A multistep paper-based analytical device (mPAD) was designed and applied to the voltammetric determination of total inorganic arsenic. The electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles on a boron-doped diamond (AuNP/BDD) electrode and the determination of total inorganic arsenic is accomplished with a single device. Total inorganic arsenic can be determined by first reducing As(V) to As(III) using thiosulfate in 1.0 mol L−1 HCl. As(III) is then deposited on the electrode surface, and total inorganic arsenic is quantified as As(III) by square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry the potential range between −0.25 V and 0.35 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), best at around 0.05 V. Under optimal conditions, the voltammetric response for As(III) detection is linear in the range from 0.1 to 1.5 μg mL−1 and the limit of detection (3SD/slope) is 20 ng mL−1. The relative standard deviation at 0.3, 0.7 and 1.0 μg mL−1 of As(III) are 3.6, 4.3 and 3.3, respectively (10 different electrodes). The results show that the assay has high precision, a rather low working potential, and excellent sensor-to-sensor reproducibility. The method was employed to the determination of total inorganic arsenic in rice samples. Results agreed well with those obtained by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

KGaA, WeinheimThe unique structural architecture of nacre from sea shells (e. g., mussel, pearl oyster, and abalone shells) is the basis of this substance's brilliant iridescent coloration. In fact, nacre consists of alternating bilayers of plate-shaped aragonite and an organic binder. In this paper, we first report the optical characteristics of individual aragonite plates derived from nacre. A simple chemical method is employed to disintegrate nacre without structural and polymorphism changes. Implementation of this method enable us to investigate the optical properties of individual aragonite plates. Evidence indicate that most light is transmitted by aragonite plates, a phenomenon that contributes substantially to the fantastic iridescent colors displayed by nacre. Reflected light, on the other hand, displays wavelength selectivity that depends on the thickness of the aragonite plates. As typical material applications, natural aragonite plates are utilized as transparent fillers and as a pigment for surface coating. Aside from their use as optical materials, aragonite plates can also be employed as a solid support for the growth of metal nanoparticles and utilize for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.\", '© The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry, 2018. Lateral flow tests (LFTs) are widely used analytical tools characterized by portability, operator simplicity and short analysis times. A remaining challenge is their limited analytical sensitivity, which in classical immunoassay formats is overcome by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) formats. The implementation of ELISA to an LFT format however, is hampered by the complexity of the procedure requiring the enzyme substrate addition after sample addition. In this work, a simple method for automation of this procedure without user interference is presented. Originally used sample pads of LFTs have been replaced by hydrophobic wax-modified filter paper-based sample pads to realize a delayed flow a pre-deposited colorimetric ELISA substrate without other alterations to the classical lateral-flow immunoassay format. The performance of the system has been characterized by visualizing flow behavior and final proof-of-concept is provided by a model mouse IgG assay, achieving a limit of detection of 15.8 ng mL -1 from just a single application of the sample solution.', '© The Royal Society of Chemistry.A series of copper complexes bearing polypyridyl tridentate ligands have been prepared to fine tune their reactivity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). During the process of preparation of our copper complexes, we successfully obtained two new crystal structures which are [Cu2(μ-Cl)2(adpa)2](ClO4)2 (2b) and [Cu2(addpa)(CH3CN)2(ClO4)2](ClO4)2 (3a) and a new structure [Cu2(addpa)(CH3CN)2(H2O)2](ClO4)4 (3b) captured after the catalytic ORR. Electrochemical studies and stoichiometric chemical reduction of copper(ii) complexes by ascorbic acid indicated that the presence of an anthracene unit helps to facilitate the reduction of Cu(ii) as well as the stabilisation of Cu(i) species. Regarding oxygen activation, the dinuclear Cu(i) complex 3a showed significantly higher ORR activity than its analogous mononuclear complex 2a. Complex 3a was also found to be relatively robust and competent in catalytic O2 reduction. The observed H2O2 product after this catalysis, together with the data obtained from DFT calculations supported that 3a exhibited a 2H+, 2e− catalytic activity towards the ORR as opposed to the expected 4H+, 4e− process usually found in copper complexes with tridentate ligands. The proton (H+) source for this process was expected from ascorbic acid which also serves as a reducing agent in this reaction. This work highlighted an approach for tuning the ORR activity of the copper complexes by the introduction of a conjugated-π moiety to the supporting ligand.', '© 2017 Elsevier B.V.A new type of copper nanoclusters was synthesized by a one-pot reaction using cysteamine as a capping agent and reducing agent (Cys-CuNCs). The synthesized CuNCs exhibited a spherical shape and a monodisperse and strong fluorescent emission characteristic peak at 430 nm when exciting at 330 nm. The Cys-CuNCs were demonstrated as a fluorescent chemodosimeter for the selective detection of Al3+. In the presence of Al3+, the fluorescent emission of the Cys-CuNCs was considerably enhanced, while other studied metal ions did not show this phenomenon. The fluorescent intensity near 380 nm linearly increased with an increasing Al3+ concentration.

PDMS strongly absorbs infrared (IR) light in the mid infrared region, which can be alleviated by using thin-film PDMS devices. However, IR detection with PDMS devices usually requires an IR-transparent backbone material. Here, we report a microfluidic system using a 160 m PDMS thin-film device (50-m path length) without a supporting backbone for IR spectroelectrochemistry (IR-SEC). The PDMS device is assembled with four layers: microchannel-supporting window, microchannel thin film, electrode-embedded thin film, and electrode-supporting window. In this work, mapping of ferrocyanide oxidation was investigated under an IR microscope. An electrochemical reaction, occurring between the working and counter electrodes, was observed clearly. Moreover, the electron-transfer process of ferrocyanide oxidation was investigated from the IR absorbance spectrum. This mapping study demonstrates that the relationship between the electrochemical reactants and products partly agree well with the Nernst equation. Accordingly, PDMS thin-film devices have the capability for studying electrochemical reactions by using IR-SEC measurements with low sample consumption.', '© 2018 Elsevier B.V.This work describes analytical approaches based on simple complexometric and argentometric titrations leading to the color change of a novel microfluidic thread-based analytical device (µTAD). The device was fabricated from a cotton thread (15 cm) treated with indicator solution, providing an easy-to-use platform for rapid measurement of analyte concentration in aqueous solution. The thread was immobilized onto a support, being a polypropylene sheet or box platform, to facilitate loading of liquid samples. Interaction between the deposited reagents and analytes in the samples then occurred within a few minutes. This resulted in zones of color change with different lengths along the thread depending on the analyte concentration. The interaction zones can be analyzed by human eyes based on comparison of the zone lengths with the printed scales which are correlated with the analyte concentrations. Complexometric titration using µTADs was initially investigated for Mg(II) determination in water and rubber latex samples. These devices consisted of two threads which were pretreated with Eriochrome Black T (EBT) and then treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS) buffer at pH 10. Both threads were tied together with a central knot before being attached to the box platform prior to the analysis. Load of sample solution (6 µL) resulted in the length of red-violet color product on the threads being proportional to the concentration of Mg(II) in waters and rubber latex samples with the working concentration range of 25–1000 mg L−1. In addition, µTAD with a supporting polypropylene sheet consisting of several threads treated with AgNO3 and K2CrO4 indicators was applied for argentometric titration of chloride ion in water and food seasoning samples. After sample loading (3 µL), the initially red-brown threads turned into white corresponding to formation of AgCl(s) on the threads with a working concentration range of 75–600 mg L−1. Greater selectivity towards Mg(II) and chloride compared with potential interference ions was also observed. All the developed μTADs were applied for analysis of real samples which showed results being in agreement with those obtained by classical titrations.', '© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.Abstract: Daidzein is an isoflavone of the group of phytoestrogens extracted from soybeans and other legumes. As its structure is relatively similar to that of the hormone estrogen, daidzein is able to bind with estrogen receptors leading to a reduced postmenopausal women symptom. A common problem of the compounds of this group is the rather low water solubility with the consequence of limited pharmaceutical applications. Inclusion complexation between daidzein and two β-CDs (β-CD and DM-β-CD) was investigated by theoretical and experimental techniques. Based on multiple MD simulations in combination with different binding-free energy calculations, the most preferential mode of daidzein binding to cyclodextrins is the insertion of the chromone ring fitting well into the hydrophobic cavity. All four methods of binding-free energy calculations (MM/PBSA, MM/GBSA, QM/PBSA, and QM/GBSA) predict the binding affinity of the daidzein/DM-β-CD complex significantly higher than the daidzein/β-CD. Following the same trend, the experimental results also indicated the enhancement of solubility and stability of the daidzein/DM-β-CD complex. Moreover, it was found that the complexation process was favorably enthalpy driven.

A series of their corresponding polyimides were obtained by the condensed polymerization of the respective monomeric isomer DATPP with a 1:1 ratio of 2,2′-bis(trifluoromethyl)-4,4′-diaminobiphenyl (PFMB) and 4,4′-hexafluoroisopropylidenediphthalic anhydride (6FDA). The inclusion of PFMB and 6FDA into the polymeric backbone causes the polymers to be moderately to highly soluble in organic polar solvents. The molar content of the respective DATPP monomer varied between 5 and 30%. All compounds were structurally characterized by 1H NMR and ATR-IR spectroscopy and the porphyrin content in the polyimides was determined by UV–Visible absorption spectroscopy. Photophysical properties consisted of measuring both the UV–Visible (ground state) absorption and fluorescence (excited state) spectra, fluorescence quantum yields (Φf), and fluorescence lifetimes (τf) in dichloromethane and N,N-dimethylacetamide. Fluorescence quenching was also measured and observed by the Stern-Volmer relationship, using 9,10-anthraquinone (AQ) as the quencher molecule. Both the bimolecular rate constant of fluorescence quenching (kq) and the Stern-Volmer constant (KQ) were calculated from this relationship. Furthermore, deviations from linearity depicted in the Stern-Volmer plots for TPP and ZnTPP at higher concentrations of AQ were also measured as a means of examining and explaining the simultaneous occurrence of dynamic (collisional) quenching and static quenching in the mechanisms of fluorescence quenching. It was found in this work that the significantly larger values in the static quenching constant (KS) than in the dynamic quenching constant (KD) are indicative that static quenching and ground state complex formation between the fluorophore and quencher is the dominant mechanism of fluorescence quenching of these systems at higher quencher concentrations.', '© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.The aim of this study was to develop a chitin/chitosan hydrocolloid (CCH) wound dressing. Chitosan was cross-linked with tripolyphosphate to prepare chitosan microbeads and then incorporated within the chitin matrix in a chitosan microbeads:chitin (w/w) ratios of 0.1–0.5:1 to fabricate the CCH hydrogels. As potential wound dressings, the chitin and CCH gels were then evaluated for their water absorption, enzymatic degradation and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and biocompatibility with the L929 cell line. The chitin gel had a water absorption of approximately 231 ± 22% of its dry weight, which was higher in the CCH gels than that prepared from chitosan microbeads:chitin (w/w) in ther ratio of 0.1:1 which had the highest water absorption (308 ± 13% of its dry weight). Both the chitin and CCH hydrogels were gradually surface-degraded by lysozyme (1.4 g/mL), being reduced to 47.5 ± 7.5 and 55.3 ± 2.9% of their wet weight, respectively, after 7 days.

The color intensity of the complex, which is indicative of the concentration of creatinine, is then quantitatively determined using ImageJ software. Various experimental parameters were optimized to achieve the best performance of the μPADs. Under the optimum conditions, a wide linear range was obtained in the range of 0.2 - 1 mM with a limit of detection and limit of quantitation of 0.08 and 0.26 mM, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method was in good agreement with the standard Jaffé method. Finally, the developed devices were successfully applied for the determination of creatinine in urine samples.', '© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These compounds were structurally characterized by extensive NMR spectroscopy analyses, comparison between experimental and theoretical NMR spectroscopic data, and X-ray crystallography. These metabolites are similar to procyanidin A and display a methyl group instead of a pendant aromatic ring at C-9, a so far unprecedented structural feature.

More importantly, these hosts are sensitive to each anionic guest, thereby resulting in change of anthracene excimer formation, displaying the solvent-dependent fluorescence and allowing us to distinguish up to four ions such as F−, OH−, CN− and PO4 3− by fluorescence spectroscopy. Depending on the solvent polarity, for example, both F− and CN− quenched the fluorescence emission intensity in THF, but only F− could enhance the fluorescence in all other solvents. The presence of PO4 3− results in fluorescence enhancements in high polarity solvents such as DMSO, DMF, and acetone, while OH− induces enhancements only in low polarity solvents (e.g. DCM and toluene). A picture of the anion recognizing ability of AnSQ was obtained through principal component analysis (PCA) with NMR and FTIR confirming the presence of host-guest interactions. Computational modeling studies demonstrate the conformation of host-guest complexation and also the change of excimer formation. Detection of F−, CN− and OH− by AnSQ hosts in THF is noticeable with the naked eye, as indicated by strong color changes arising from charge transfer complex formation upon anion addition.', '© 2018 The Chemical Society of Japan.Thirteen flavones including chrysin, three natural and nine synthesized compounds, were examined for antibacterial activity. 6,8-Dibromo- (11) and 6,8-diiodo-5,7-dihydroxyflavone (12) exhibited the highest activity against all bacteria with MIC 31.2562.5 μM. For Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus, these compounds were bacteriostatic agents, while for Streptococcus sobrinus, S. mutans, and Salmonella typhi, they were bactericidal agents. The combination of 11 and 12 with known antibiotics displayed synergistic effect. The combination of 11 with streptomycin (16) revealed the most synergistic effect with rate in increasing antibacterial activity of streptomycin in combination was sixteen folds against P. acnes, S. sobrinus, and S. mutans.', '© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimA cationic porphyrin, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridinio)porphyrin tetraiodide (TMPyP) was reported herein to exert selective, turn-off fluorescence when complexed with Cu2+ ion. Although discernible spectroscopic changes of charged porphyrins with various metal ions were previously utilized as colorimetric sensors, the application of fluorescence quenching of charged porphyrins with Cu2+ ion has never been investigated in much detail before. Coupled with the ease of synthesis, the finding led to a construction of a simple paper-based sensor for Cu2+ with good selectivity and sensitivity, with a limit of detection at 0.16 ppm, which is below the recommended amount in drinking water. Notably, this performance could be achieved with the need of only a handheld UV lamp and a smartphone or a compact camera, both of which are now considered to be highly accessible. Thanks to the simplicity of all involved processes, this study highlights a unique way in creating a new practical and economical sensor for Cu2+ ion.', '© 2018 Elsevier B.V.A simple and highly sensitive procedure based on the combination of hollow fiber membrane liquid phase microextraction and a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (µPAD) was developed for pre-concentration and determination of hexavalent chromium in water samples. The hexavalent chromium was pre-concentrated using the HF-LPME technique via ion exchange or a coupled transport process through a supported ionic liquid (Aliquat 336) prior to colorimetric detection with diphenylcarbazide on the µPAD. The violet colour could be seen by the naked eye. Images from the µPADs were scanned using a commercial desktop scanner at 600 dpi resolution. ImageJ software was used for quantitative analysis by measuring the intensity values at green colour channel since it gave the best sensitivity among the RGB colour. Under optimal conditions, the calibration curve was linear in the range 10–90 µg L-1, with a limit of detection of 3 µg L-1. The developed method was successfully applied to determine the level of hexavalent chromium spiked into natural water samples at the parts-per-billion (ppb) level, and the results were in good agreement with those obtained using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The developed method was able to improve the detection limit of the conventional µPAD, and was expected to be used for the effective analysis of hexavalent chromium in natural water.', '© 2018 American Chemical Society.In this work, we developed a catalyst-free amination of 2-mercaptobenzoxazoles on water under microwave irradiation. The product, 2-aminobenzoxazoles, was successfully produced via direct amination with various amines in moderate to high yields. The formal synthesis of Suvorexant, a medication for the treatment of insomnia, was accomplished using a developed amination process. The reaction was completed in an hour at 100-150 °C in a microwave reactor without the use of external catalyst or additive. Key benefits of this process include an on-water reaction, short reaction time, being scalable and catalyst-free, and use of 2-mercaptobenzoxazoles as an inexpensive starting material having low environmental impact in its preparation.', '© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThis study presents a new approach for an electrochemical immunoassay using gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-labeled antibodies and pre-oxidation and reduction processes, followed by open circuit potential (OCP) measurement. Detection of the pregnancy marker, human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG), was used as a model. After preparation of a sandwich-type immunosystem, the pre-oxidation and reduction processes were applied, followed by OCP detection. The applied potential and time period were studied for the optimization of pre-oxidation and reduction processes. We observed that the pre-oxidation potential of 1.2 V for 60 s and reduction potential of −0.2 V for 30 s provided the highest OCP signal. The detection limit was 79 pg/mL using the optimal conditions. This system could be applied to a simplified and miniaturized diagnostic system for integration in compact analytical devices.', '© 2018 American Chemical Society.We report the fabrication of an amperometric NADH biosensor system that employs an allosterically modulated bacterial reductase in an adapted osmium(III)-complex-modified redox polymer film for analyte quantification. Chains of complexed Os(III) centers along matrix polymer strings make electrical connection between the immobilized redox protein and a graphite electrode disc, transducing enzymatic oxidation of NADH into a biosensor current. Sustainable anodic signaling required (1) a redox polymer with a formal potential that matched the redox switch of the embedded reductase and avoided interfering redox interactions and (2) formation of a cross-linked enzyme/polymer film for stable biocatalyst entrapment. The activity of the chosen reductase is enhanced upon binding of an effector, i.e. p-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid (p-HPA), allowing the acceleration of the substrate conversion rate on the sensor surface by in situ addition or preincubation with p-HPA. Acceleration of NADH oxidation amplified the response of the biosensor, with a 1.5-fold increase in the sensitivity of analyte detection, compared to operation without the allosteric modulator. Repetitive quantitative testing of solutions of known NADH concentration verified the performance in terms of reliability and analyte recovery. We herewith established the use of allosteric enzyme modulation and redox polymer-based enzyme electrode wiring for substrate biosensing, a concept that may be applicable to other allosteric enzymes.', '© 2019 the Partner Organisations.Metal-free insertion of sulfur dioxide with aryl iodides and silyl enolates or allylic bromide under ultraviolet irradiation at room temperature is accomplished. This protocol provides a convenient route to sulfonated cyclic compounds under mild conditions. Not only N-(2-iodophenyl)-N-methylmethacrylamides but also 1-iodo-2-Allenoxybenzene is workable. A plausible mechanism is proposed, which shows that during the reaction process, aryl radicals formed in situ from aryl iodides under ultraviolet irradiation undergo intramolecular 5-exo-cyclization, with subsequent sulfonylation via insertion of sulfur dioxide. The resulting sulfonyl radicals are further trapped by silyl enolates or allylic bromide giving rise to sulfonated cyclic compounds.', '© 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.A clam-shaped molecule comprising a Zn(II)-porphyrin and a Zn(II)-cyclam is synthesized and characterized. Its electrochemical behavior and catalytic activity for homogeneous electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) are investigated by cyclic voltammetry and compared with those of Zn(II)-meso-tetraphenylporphyrin and Zn(II)-cyclam. Under N2-saturated conditions, cyclic voltammetry of the featured complex has characteristics of its two constituents, but under CO2-saturated conditions, the target compound exhibits significant current enhancement. Iterative reduction under electrochemical conditions indicated the target compound has improved stability relative to Zn(II)-cyclam. Controlled potential electrolysis demonstrates that, without addition of water, methane (CH4) is the only detectable product with 1% Faradaic efficiency (FE). The formation of CH4 is not observed under the catalysis of the Zn(II)-porphyrin benchmark compound, indicating that the CO2-capturing function of the Zn(II)-cyclam unit contributes to the catalysis. Upon addition of 3% v/v water, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in the presence of the target compound gives carbon monoxide (CO) with 28% FE. Dominance of CO formation under these conditions suggests enhancement of proton-coupled reduction. Integrated action of these Zn(II)-porphyrin and Zn(II)-cyclam units offers a notable example of a molecular catalytic system where the cyclam ring captures and brings CO2 into the proximity of the porphyrin catalysis center.', '© 2019In this work, (E)-2-((2-butyl-4-chloro-1H-imidazol-5-yl)methylene)-N-methylhydrazine-carbothioamide (L) and its Cu(II), Ni(II) and Mn(II) complexes were synthesized. The ligand (L) characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, IR, HRMS and UV-Visible techniques and theoretical calculations have been performed at DFT level of theory using B3LYP functional and 6-31G (d, p) as a basis set. The molecular geometrical parameters, frontier molecular orbital energies (HOMO, LUMO) and their energy gap (ΔE = 0.1009 eV) have been calculated.

In this regard, green-based agarose gel electromembrane extraction (G-EME) was for the first time combined with dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME) toward G-EME/DLLME methodology (i.e., tandem extraction approach). Two basic drugs such as trimipramine (TRI) and clomipramine (CLO) extracted from the urine samples, were used as model compounds. Regarding method workflow, analytes were extracted from the 5 mL sample, through a synthesized agarose gel membrane, to the 700 µL aqueous acceptor phase under the optimized conditions (pH of acceptor phase: 2.0; pH of gel membrane: 2.0; pH of donor phase: 4.0, voltage value: 30 V, and extraction time: 25 min). In the next step, acceptor solution was poured to a conic vial and mixed with 100 µL alkaline solution (NaOH, 1 M). Afterwards, DLLME procedure took place again at optimal conditions, i.e., extraction solvent was carbon tetrachloride (10 µL), and dispersive solvent was acetone (100 µL). Ultimately, gas chromatography (GC) was applied for the detection and quantification of drugs. Such G-EME/DLLME configuration has brought two main advantages. Firstly, interferences such as proteins and other large biological molecules were eliminated from biological fluids via G-EME. Further, high enrichment factors (EFs of 260–370 refer to extraction recoveries of 52–74%) were obtained using DLLME with acceptable detection limits (1.0–3.0 ng mL−1). Finally, the suggested approach was successfully utilized to determine drugs at trace levels in urine samples.', '© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

As a result of poor post-harvest drying and inappropriate storage conditions, rice grains are often damaged through fungal spoilage as well as mycotoxin production. The objective of this research was to evaluate the possibility of using the near infrared spectroscopy, with a wavenumber range between 12500 and 4000 cm−1 (800–2500 nm), as a rapid method for detection of aflatoxins in brown rice. Firstly, storage trials were carried out to generate representative of samples contaminated and non-contaminated with aflatoxins. These data were used to create a partial least squares regression model using 120 brown rice samples with the required near infrared spectral data and aflatoxin concentration levels that were determined using a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays method. The accuracy of developed models was externally validated using the test set. The statistical model developed from the treated spectra (vector normalization; SNV) provided the best accuracy in prediction with a coefficient of determination of prediction (r2) of 0.95, a root mean square error of prediction of 415.00 µg kg−1 and a bias −54.00 µg kg−1.

A new and facile approach to stabilise copper(i) complexes in aqueous solution by the addition of zinc(ii) ions in combination with acetate ions (OAc − ) was demonstrated. This stability enhancement toward the aerobic oxidation of copper(i) species was investigated by various techniques including UV-vis spectroscopy, 1 H-NMR, FT-IR, and ESI-MS. Our experimental results together with DFT calculations led to a proposed structure of [(adpa)Cu-OAc-Zn(OAc)(H 2 O) 2 ] +/2+ . It was also postulated that zinc(ii) with its Lewis acidity may attract electrons from the Cu centre through the bridging ligands (OAc − ), resulting in the lower reactivity of Cu(i) with O 2 . In addition, this strategy was shown to be applicable to ascorbic acid detection by monitoring a change in the redox states of copper complexes using fluorescence spectroscopy.

The applied use of ENMs have led to their enormous production. They are released to the environment either deliberately or accidentally. Plants are the major producer of food to the ecosystem. Nanomaterials have been used in plants to improve the physical properties. But these nanomaterials are known to cause toxicity to the plants. There are various ways in which the nanoparticles can enter the plants. The uptake of the ENMs to different part of the plant depend on their concentration, bioavailability, solubility and exposure time. After uptake by the plants they are accumulated in different parts viz. leaves, fruit, flower and seeds. ENMs affect plant physical properties, biochemical processes, enzymatic activities and genetic material.

However, the low water solubility of these two compounds limits their use in many pharmaceutical applications. Beta-cyclodextrin (βCD) and its derivatives (e.g., methylated (M) and hydroxypropylated (HP) βCDs) have been extensively used to enhance the stability and solubility of many hydrophobic guest molecules through an encapsulation process into the lipophilic inner cavity. In the present study, the dynamics behavior and the stability of inclusion complexes of two flavonoids LL and PB with βCDs were studied using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and MM/PB(GB)SA free energy calculations. The obtained results showed that the van der Waals driven encapsulation of LL and PB could adapt the structure of the βCDs to become more stable conformers via an enhanced intramolecular hydrogen bond formation on the secondary rim. The structural data and free energy results demonstrated that the phenyl orientation was the preferred binding mode for LL and PB inclusion complexations.

In this work, we propose image acquisition from colloidal solutions of AgNPrs using a combination of transmitted and scattered light. The developed measurement technique could be carried out by separately recording transmitted and scattering images of the solutions, using a mobile device camera prior to a calculation of the empirical absorption value (IA). The IA value of green for AgNPrs solutions was found to be in agreement with the absorption spectra obtained using a conventional spectroscopic technique. This technique was utilized for the quantifications of hydrogen peroxide and glucose. Good linearities between ΔIA and those typical analytes were observed. The limit of detection for the typical biosensor of glucose was 19.8 μM.

Structural, electronic, and optical properties are analyzed, and it is found that non-isotropic distribution of In−N (type C) possesses the minimum free energy for the InGaAsN conventional cell system. An increasing indium content reduces the formation enthalpy of InGaAsN. The formation enthalpy, conduction band minimum, strength of covalent bonds, and electron density differences in free space of InGaAsN are decreased under high-pressure conditions. The dielectric performance and static permittivity of InGaAsN are lower than that of GaAs, for which the dielectric performance transforms to conductor performance at high frequency.

Furthermore, as a result of their unique electronic structures, these boranes display a fluorescence response to fluoride anion characterized by a blue shift in the case of 1 and a red shift in the case of 2.', '© 2019 American Chemical Society.A coordination complex, lithium hepta(i-butyl)silsesquioxane trisilanolate (1; Li-T7), a stable intermediate in silsesquioxane (SQ) syntheses, was successfully isolated in 65% yield and found to be highly soluble in nonpolar solvents such as hexane. The structure of Li-T7 was confirmed by NMR, IR spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and computational simulation, providing detailed elucidation of the intermolecular self-association of the SQ cage with a box-shaped Li6O6 polyhedron through strong coordination bonds. After acid treatment, Li-T7 undergoes lithium-proton cationic exchange, yielding hepta(i-butyl)silsesquioxane trisilanol (2; H-T7) quantitatively. The high yield of H-T7 seems to be influenced by Li-O bonding in the Li-T7 complex that affects the selective formation of hepta(i-butyl)silsesquioxane trisilanolate and the bulky i-butyl groups which may prevent decomposition or SQ cage-rearrangement even at reflux under alkaline conditions. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography confirms the presence of the dumbbell-shaped SQ partial cages through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, lowering the polarity of the reaction solution by adding dichloromethane results in formation of the cubic octa(i-butyl)silsesquioxane (3; T8) cage in a good yield (47%), which is isolated by crystallization from the reaction solution.', '© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.A paper-based electrochemical sensor is described that is based on the use of thiol-terminated poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC-SH) that was self-assembled on a gold nanoparticle-modified screen-printed electrode (SPE). The SPE sensor was used for label-free detection of C-reactive protein (CRP). Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were first electrodeposited on the SPCE, followed by the self-assembly of PMPC-SH on gold. The electrochemical response of the modified SPE to CRP was measured by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). If the CRP on the paper device is contacted with Ca (II) ions, the current (measured by using hexacyanoferrate as the electrochemical probe) decreases. The signal drops in the 5 to 5000 ng·mL−1 CRP concentration range, and the lower detection limit (at 3 SD/slope) is 1.6 ng·mL−1. The use of a PMPC-modified surface also reduces the nonspecific adsorption of proteins. The sensor is not interfered by bilirubin, myoglobin and albumin. It was successfully applied to CRP detection in certified human serum. This sensor is applicable as an attractive protocol for an inexpensive, highly sensitive, and disposable material for electrochemical detection of CRP.

This sensor was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Then, this sensor was used to measure pH and lactate concentration using the same sweat sample. The sensing element for sweat pH was composed of a mixture of methyl orange and bromocresol green while a lactate enzymatic assay was chosen for the lactate sensor. The pH indicator gradually shifted from red to blue as the pH increased, whereas the purple color intensity increased with the concentration of lactate in the sweat. By comparing these colors with a standard calibration, this platform can be used to estimate the sweat pH (1−14) and the lactate level (0–25 mM). Fading of the colors of this sensor was prevented by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The flexibility of this textile based sensor allows it to be incorporated into sport apparels and accessories hence potentially enabling real-time and continuous monitoring of sweat pH and lactate. This non-invasive sensing platform might open a new avenue for personal health monitoring and medical diagnosis as well as for determining of the physiological conditions of endurance athletes.', '© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Trihalomethanes (THMs) were used as model analytes. Three types of carbon nanosorbents (graphite, graphene, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes) were studied. The carbon sorbent incorporating membrane was used in a two-phase mode liquid-phase microextraction, with 1-octanol as the acceptor solution. Using a graphite-reinforced hollow-fiber membrane and an extraction time of 10 min, enrichment factors of 40–71 were obtained for trichloromethane, bromodichloromethane, bromoform, and chlorodibromomethane. Linear working ranges of 0.2–100 μg L−1 and limits of detection ranging from 0.01 μg L−1 (for CHCl2Br and CHClBr2) to 0.1 μg L−1 (for CHCl3) were achieved. The minimum detectable concentrations were far below the maximum concentration levels (60–200 μg L−1) set by the WHO for drinking water. The carbon-sorbent-reinforced hollow-fiber liquid-phase microextraction afforded higher extraction efficiency and shorter extraction time compared with conventional hollow-fiber liquid-phase microextraction. Finally, the method was applied to the analysis of real water samples, such as drinking water, tap water, and swimming pool water samples.', '© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (C2DGC) offers excellent separation efficiency that serves advanced analysis of volatiles and semi-volatiles in multicomponent and multiple chemical class samples.

The egg matrix was removed based on protein precipitation principles. Several protein precipitation methods were investigated. The treatment using trichloroacetic acid satisfactorily removed most of the egg matrix components. A colorless solution and a good signal were achieved.

The biosensor shows excellent electro-catalytic activity towards oxidation of hydroquinone at a potential of -0.05 V (vs Ag/AgCl, 3 M KCl) in phosphate buffer as supporting electrolyte (0.1 M, pH 7.0) using hydrodynamic amperometry. Analytical characteristics uncover that the LACC/AuNP/GNPl/SPCE comprises a wide linear range for the dependence of the signal on HQ concentrations from 4 to 130 µM with a detection limit (3σ) of 1.5 µM. The repeatability (5 measurements, 100 µM hydroquinone) is ±2% and the reproducibility (5 biosensors, 100 µM hydroquinone) is ±3%. Interference studies of most common compounds with the determination of hydroquinone demonstrated negligible effects. Finally, the biosensor and the analytical method were applied to the determination of phenolic antioxidant capacity (AOC) in wine and blueberry syrup based on Trolox (6‑hydroxy‑2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid) and hydroquinone equivalents.

Thus, the performance quality of these service agents is important to be studied by evaluating the interaction between customers and service employees. The objectives of this study, based on the Customer Orientation of Service Employees (COSE) model, are to examine the impact of key outcomes of customer orientation of service employees on Thai student’s behaviour towards international education agents, to determine the dimensions of customer’s behaviour s (customer satisfaction, emotional commitment, and customer retention) toward agents, and to measure Thai student’s behaviour levels towards international student recruitment services. This study used a survey to collect data of 400 respondents who have experience in using recruitment services from international education agents. To test the hypotheses, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was performed. The findings revealed that customer orientation of service agents has significantly influenced customer satisfaction and emotional commitment, but not influenced customer retention. In addition, customers’ satisfaction has an effect on emotion commitment. Consequently, emotion commitment has a significant effect on customer retention.', '© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.A disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) modified with an ionic liquid/graphene composite (IL/G) exhibits a wider potential window, excellent conductivity, and specific surface area for the improvement in the voltammetric signal of rapamycin detection. The modified composite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical behavior of rapamycin at the modified SPCE was investigated by cyclic and square wave voltammetry in 60:40 EtOH: 0.1 M LiClO4 at pH 5.0. A high reproducible and well-defined peak with a high peak current were obtained for rapamycin detection at a position potential of + 0.98 V versus Ag/AgCl. Under the optimized conditions, the rapamycin concentration in the range 0.1 to 100 μM (R2 = 0.9986) had a good linear relation with the peak current. The detection limit of this method was 0.03 μM (3SD/slope). The proposed device can selectively detect rapamycin in the presence of commonly interfering compounds. Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied to determine rapamycin in urine and blood samples with excellent recoveries. These devices are disposable and cost-effective and might be used as an alternative tool for detecting rapamycin in biological samples and other biological compounds.

The assay is based on the Cu2+-induced aggregation of L-cys-AgNPls. In the presence of Cu2+, L-cys-AgNPls were aggregated immediately and the color of solution was distinctly changed from violet to blue within 5 min. This method enabled the quantitative measurement of Cu2+ with sample volumes as low as 5 µL. Under optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) was 1 ppm and 0.34 ppm by naked eye and smartphone with RGB application, respectively. For quantitative analysis, the calibration curve was constructed by plotting the differences in absorbance ratio at wavelengths of 620 nm and 570 nm (A620/A570) of sample and blank as a function of Cu2+ concentration. This assay detected Cu2+ in the range of 0.25 to 6 ppm (R2 = 0.9951) and the LOD was 0.22 ppm. In addition, L-cys-AgNPls exhibited good selectivity for Cu2+. Additionally, the developed method was successfully applied for rapid screening of Cu2+ in real wastewater samples with % recovery in the range of 73.08 to 114.62 and 93.48 to 114.04 by UV-visible spectrometry and smartphone with RGB application, respectively. The results from the developed method were compared with those from atomic absorption spectrometry and no significant difference was found between the two methods.

When electric field is used as an actuator of ion transport in G-EME, the EEO flow phenomenon can occur within the agarose gel membrane interface and is generally considered the dominant issue. In this regard, various agarose-based gel membrane types with low-, medium- and high-EEO were fabricated and tested. To further diminish the EEO effect, the different gel membrane additives such as dextrin, chitosan and xylan with different concentrations i.e., 5%, 10% and 15% were also examined. The positively charged Cr(III) and negatively charged Cr(VI) were chosen as model analytes. The Cr(III) and Cr(VI) were simultaneously extracted from an aqueous sample (pH 3.0) via the cathodic and anodic gel membranes (pH 3.0 for both membranes), into the cathodic and anodic aqueous acceptors (200 µL each, pH 2.0), respectively. After extraction at the optimal conditions (i.e., voltage: 32 V, extraction time: 22 min), the both compounds were quantified by a cheap and easy-to-perform reader platform termed as microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD). The results showed that high extraction recoveries such as 87% for Cr(III) and 75% for Cr(VI), were acquired when the low-EEO agarose gel membrane with 5% (w/v) dextrin was used. On the other hand, using the high-EEO agarose gel membrane with no additive lead to the high EEO flow and the increase of cathodic acceptor volume (equal to 350 µL) while the recovery depressed to about 50% due to the dilution effect. Simultaneously, the volume of anodic acceptor became almost vacant (~50 µL). Ultimately, by means of such simple gel membrane adjusting (i.e., low-EEO agarose with 5% dextrin), the both target compounds were quantitatively extracted at a single step achieving limits of detection (LODs) of 0.5 and 0.7 ng mL−1 for Cr(III) and Cr(VI), respectively.', '© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

When the traditional medicine is a choice for health therapy, the simple and reliable equipment is required to control the suitable consum-ing amount of the active component. Objective: To develop the electrochemical sensor for genistein determination in Derris scandens with high sensitivity and rapid operation. Methods: An in-house screen-printed electrochemical sensor consisting of a three-electrode system was developed for genistein determination. A silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference electrode, a carbon counter electrode and a carbon working electrode were prepared on a 0.3-mm-thick plastic substrate by the screen-printing technique using conductive ink. The dimensions of each sensor were 2.5×1.0 cm. Only 50 µL of sample solution was required on this device for the determination of genistein concentration by rapid response square wave voltammetry. Results: The oxidation peak of genistein appeared with good response in acidic media at a peak potential of 0.6 V. Moreover, the signal was enhanced by modifying the conductive carbon ink with co-balt(II) phthalocyanine. Under the optimized conditions, the linear range was found to be 2.5-150 µM and the detection limit was 1.5 µM. Moreover, the small volume extraction was successfully developed without any further pre-concentration. This proposed method was applied to determine genistein in Derris scandens with satisfying results. Conclusion: The proposed method is promising as an alternative method for genistein determination with facile and fast analysis.', '© 2020 The Chemical Society of JapanCopper nanoparticles fabricated onto reduced graphene oxide (Cu NPs/rGO) were successfully synthesized via a one-pot dimethylformamide (DMF) reduction approach with an addition of nominal water. This small amount of water can significantly decrease the degree of GO reduction by DMF. As a result, the remaining oxygen-containing functionality on rGO can still interact with the copper cation precursor leading to the high Cu content fabricated onto the support material, which was evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Moreover, small particle sizes and high dispersion of Cu NPs on rGO were confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).

A maximum CO conversion level of 94% was obtained with 1% by weight Au/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 at 50 °C, while the presence of water and carbon dioxide in the feed stream had only a slight effect on the catalytic activity. Catalyst characterizations were performed to investigate the effect of the Ce:Zr molar ratios on the redox properties and physicochemical properties of the obtained Au/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts. It was found that a certain amount of Ce in the Au/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst promoted solid solution formation and facilitated the activity of Au3+ and Au0 nanoparticles with a small crystallite size. The enhanced catalytic activity of Au/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 was attributed to the presence of more oxygen vacancies, easier reducibility, and appropriate amount of Au3+ species, as confirmed by Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy and hydrogen-temperature-programme reduction analyses, respectively. The catalytic activity showed a high stability for a long period of time (28 h).', 'Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.This work aims to utilize diamond-like carbon (DLC) thin films for bioreceptor immobilization and amperometric biosensing in a microfluidic platform. A specific RF-PECVD method was employed to prepare DLC thin film electrodes with desirable surface and bulk properties. The films possessed a relatively high sp2 fraction, a moderate electrical conductivity (7.75 × 10-3 S cm-1), and an optical band gap of 1.67 eV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy revealed a presence of oxygen-containing functional groups on the DLC surface. The DLC electrodes were integrated into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic electrochemical cells with the channel volume of 2.24 μL. Glucose oxidase (GOx) was chosen as a model bioreceptor to validate the employment of DLC electrodes for bioelectrochemical sensing. In-channel immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx) at the DLC surface was realized through carbodiimide covalent linkages. Enzyme bound DLC electrode was confirmed with the redox potential at around -79 mV vs NHE in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Amperometric flow-injection glucose sensing at a potential of -0.45 V vs Ag in the absence of standard redox mediators showed the increase of current response upon increasing the glucose concentration. The sensing mechanism is based on the reduction process of H2O2 liberated from the enzymatic activity. The proposed model for the catalytic H2O2 reduction to H2O on DLC electrodes was attributed to the dissociation of C-O bonds at the DLC surface.', '© 2020 The Chemical Society of JapanBigels consist of a relatively new group of soft materials, developed using two or more networks to achieve synergistic multifunctionalities.

The DT is constructed from a flexible printed circuit board (PCB), with a bespoke \"dog-leg\"track design, that can be rolled up for ease of assembly. This approach incorporates a shielding layer, as part of the flexible PCB design, and represents the minimum dimensional footprint conceivable for a DT.

Five conformers of the α-mangostin dye were obtained using three different polarizable continuum model (PCM)/density functional theory (DFT) methods: wB97XD/6-31+G(d,p), M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p), and B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p). The species distribution of the five conformers in acetonitrile, water, and the gas phase was derived from the Gibbs free energy changes of their interconversion equilibria. Three dominant conformers (Conformers 2, 3, and 4) were found as coexisting species in solvents. Chemical descriptors of the three dominant conformers of the α-mangostin in acetonitrile and water were obtained. Simulated UV–Vis spectra of the existing conformers and their mixtures in acetonitrile and water derived from the PCM/TD-DFT calculations were in good agreement with experimental results. Because the three dominant conformers of α-mangostin absorb light in the UV region, the application of α-mangostin dye for UV protection is suggested.

The key to differentiation is the use of a conformationally constrained peptide nucleic acid (PNA) that was immobilized on carboxymethylcellulose-modified paper. This was then used for target DNA binding and visualization by an enzyme-catalyzed pigmentation. The biotinylated target DNA bound to the immobilized probe was visually detected via alkaline phosphatase-linked streptavidin. This enzyme conjugate catalyzed the dephosphorylation of the substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, leading to a series of reactions that generate an intense, dark blue pigment. The test was validated with 100 DNA samples, which shows good discrimination among different genotypes (normal, HbE, and heterozygous) with 100% accuracy when optimal conditions of analysis were applied.

A flower-like platinum structure with the homogeneous distribution of PtNFs/rGO on the screen-printed carbon electrode surface was clearly observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical behaviors of PtNFs/rGO electrode were systematically investigated by CV. Comparing with an unmodified electrode, PtNFs/rGO electrode provided 5-fold increase in anodic peak current. This newly fabricated electrode not only accelerated the electron transfer between diclofenac and the electrode surface but also promoted the accumulation of diclofenac on electrode surface leading to enhanced electrochemical sensitivity for the quantitative analysis of diclofenac. By using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), a calibration curve of diclofenac was linear in a range of 0.1−100 µM, and a limit of detection was found to be 40 nM (S/N = 3). Eventually, this system was successfully applied for the determination of diclofenac in human urine samples.', '© 2020 the Partner Organisations.A copper-catalyzed three-component reaction of N-tosyl acrylamides, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-sulfur dioxide and phenyliodine(iii) dicarboxylates is developed. This transformation using phenyliodine(iii) dicarboxylates as alkyl radical precursors and N-tosyl amidyl as the weakly coordinating directing group provides diverse (Z)-β-alkenyl alkylsulfones in moderate to good yields through direct C(sp2)-H alkylsulfonylation. This decarboxylative alkylsulfonylation from sulfur dioxide under copper catalysis proceeds efficiently, and the weak nitrogen coordination provides excellent regio- A nd stereoselectivities. Moreover, the synthetic practicability of this transformation is demonstrated through a gram-scale synthesis.

Two of these compounds exhibit excellent selective fluorescent enhancement by CN- in aqueous media with detection limits of 0.066 and 0.087 μM.

However, identifying the development of emerging technologies related to this biopolymer is difficult, especially for newcomers trying to understand the research streams. In this work, we designed and implemented a research process based on a bibliometric predictive intelligence model. Our aim is to glean detailed scientific and technological trends through an analysis of publications that include certain word phrases and related research areas. Cross correlation, factor mapping, and the calculation of \"emergent\"scores were also used. A total of 1,612 scientific papers on chitosan technology related to viral disease treatment published between 2010 and 2020 were retrieved from the Web of Science. Results from the keyword modelling quantitatively highlight three major frontier research and development topic groups: Drug delivery and adjuvants, vaccines and immune response, and tissue engineering. More specifically, the emergent scores show that much of the chitosan-based treatment for viral diseases is in the in vitro stage of development. Most chitosan applications are in pharmacology/pharmacy and immunology. All results were confirmed by experts in the field, which indicates that the validated process can be applied to other fields of interest.', '© the Partner Organisations.Nitro-containing compounds are important structural moieties in drugs, natural products, and small molecule therapeutics, and are widely used in a variety of organic transformations.

Investigations of noble metals in this class are growing rapidly, leading to discoveries of catalysts with new properties. Characterization of these materials is challenging because the metal atoms reside on surfaces that are typically nonuniform in composition and structure. We posit that understanding of structures and catalytic properties of these materials is emerging most strongly from investigations of structurally uniform catalysts (metal atoms dispersed on crystalline supports) which can be characterized incisively with atomic-resolution electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy, bolstered by density functional theory. We assess the literature of such catalysts supported on zeotype materials, metal-organic frameworks, and covalent organic frameworks. Assessing characterization, reactivity, and catalytic performance of catalysts for oxidation, hydrogenation, the water-gas shift reaction, and others, we consider metal-support interactions and ligand effects for various metal-support combinations, evaluating the degree of structural uniformity of exemplary catalysts and summarizing structure-reactivity and structure-catalytic property relationships.', '© 2020 Elsevier B.V.This chapter describes the importance of PADs for biomarker detection.

The different TiO2 phases were synthesized using different types of acid: acetic (HAc), nitric, and a mixture of HAc and hydrochloric acids, and hydrothermal (90 or 200 °C) or calcination (560 or 750 °C) temperatures. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the crystal structure of successfully synthesized TiO2 with different TiO2-A:TiO2-R ratios.

The approach enabled electrochemical treatment of odor active compounds in perfume extract. The samples before and after 2-phase-EC at cathode, anode and between the two electrodes left for equilibrium after the treatment were analyzed by using solid phase micro extraction (SPME) and gas chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry (GC−MS). This allowed identification of volatile compounds in each sample based on comparison with MS and retention index database. After the treatment, the perfume smells were fresher, sweeter and more floral corresponding to their different types and amounts of the odor active compounds. The major odor active products mainly obtained at the anode of the 2-phase-EC system were methyl benzoate, 2-phenylethanol and benzyl acetate. The corresponding product at the cathode was phenylmethanol. Comparison of the investigated sample profiles further reveals enrichment of several compounds at each electrode without undergoing electrochemical reaction. The major reactant and product profiles were further investigated with Gas Analyzer revealing slower rate of decrease in the amounts of the characteristic m/z of the products during the 2-phase EC. The 2-phase-EC and analytical approach have a potential for application in the area of electrochemical reaction in organic media in the future.', '© 2021 Elsevier B.V.A smartphone-based technique for determining the titration equivalence point from a linear-segment curve was developed for the first time. In this method, a titrant in an increasing microliter-volume was added to a set of sample aliquots containing an indicator covering both sides of the equivalence point. The solutions were subsequently photographed in one shot, in a dark box using a smartphone camera and an illuminating screen of a tablet or light emitting diode lamps arranged below a white acrylic sheet as a light source. After the colors of the solutions were delineated to Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) values, 1/log G was used to construct a plot in which the equivalence point was located at the intersection of the two lines in the region before and after the equivalence point. The technique was successfully applied to the miniaturized titration of sodium chloride injections, showing the good linear relationship of equivalence points to the sodium chloride concentration in the range of 0.4163–0.9675% w/v (R2 of 0.9998). The assay was accurate (% recovery of 98.92–100.52), precise (% relative standard deviation ≤ 1.20), and unaffected by the use of different types of microplates, smartphones, and RGB analysis tools.

The centrosymmetric M2L2mesocate forms through the side-by-side coordination of two L ligands to a pair of M(ii) ions. The mesocates exhibit a reversible temperature induced desolvation-solvation behavior without losing their structural integrity. The activated1Co, as the representative M2L2mesocate, shows an exceptionally high MeOH vapour uptake capacity of 481.9 cm3g−1(68.8 wt%) at STP with good recyclability.

In addition, quantum chemical-based conductor-like screening model for realistic solvents (COSMO-RS) software was used to predict the molecular interaction between low transition temperature mixtures (LTTMs) and pyrethroids based on their σ-profile, σ-potentials, and activity coefficient at infinite dilution. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed for the further separation of the pyrethroids and their quantification. Several key parameters that affect pyrethroid extraction efficiency are identified as the vortex time, type of LTTM, volume of LTTM, type of dispersive solvent, dispersive solvent volume, type of salt, and amount of salt. The extraction time of 90 s and 150 µL of menthol: sesamol at ratio 1:1 were selected as the best conditions, while ionic strength and type of dispersant solvent were not relevant for the extraction of the target compounds. After optimization, the menthol-LTTM-VADLLME method was found to be able to detect pyrethroids in the range of 0.5–1000.0 μg/L with good linearity (correlation coefficient = 0.9988–0.9995). The method detection limit and quantification limit were found to be in the range of 0.05–0.11 μg/L and 0.18–0.35 μg/L, respectively. The relative standard deviation of inter-day and intra-day precisions were 2.2–5.0% (n = 5) and 1.2–1.9% (n = 7) respectively. The optimized method can successively determine pyrethroids in tap, drinking and river water samples with good recoveries of 73–111%.

In accord with The Sustainable Development Goal from The United Nation Development Program, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is viewed as environmentally friendly and is widely used. Small HCs can be directly synthesized from CO2 hydrogenation over a hybrid catalyst. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the direct synthesis of LPG from CO2 hydrogenation using a copper/zinc oxide/zirconium/alumina (CZZA) mixed metal and HY zeolite as a hybrid catalyst. The study was conducted in a fixed bed reactor using hydrogen/CO2/carbon monoxide as the reactant gas and evaluating four types of production condition, method of catalyst combination, reaction temperature, CZZA/HY zeolite mass ratio, and catalyst weight/volume flow rate. The mixing type between the CZZA and HY zeolite catalysts markedly influenced the HC selectivity with strong suppression of reverse water gas shift reaction.

Initially, the composite sensors are laboratory tested for the material selection. Various effects are investigated namely: solvent types for preparing the composites; mixing with hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) to improve the methanol response and surface adhesion; number of coating layers; and also sensor performances. The GO/dPIn prepared in acetone provides the highest relative current response towards methanol. The GO/dPIn/HPC achieves not only a good adhesion but also an increase in methanol response, especially 0.5 g of GO/dPIn mixed with 0.75 g of HPC. One coating layer, the relative current response reaches the highest value under N2. However, it decreases in ambient air due to the effects of humidity and interfering gases. Besides, the high applied voltage leads to the increase in methanol response but the sensing layer is damaged by heat generation. Finally, the sensor is integrated with a portable sensor platform, connected by NFC to a mobile phone. The sensitivity is 0.0123 ppm−1 in the dynamic range 97–1041 ppm at the applied voltage of 0.8 V under ambient air, whereas the response and recovery times are within 12–50 s depending on methanol concentration.', '© This work presents a simple hydrothermal synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs), fabrication of microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD), and their joint application for colorimetric determination of total cholesterol (TC) in human blood. The N-CDs were characterized by various techniques including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and the optical and electronic properties of computational models were studied using the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The characterization results confirmed the successful doping of nitrogen on the surface of carbon dots.

Particularly, since hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the oxidative product of cholesterol in the presence of cholesterol oxidase, a sensitive and selective method of cholesterol detection was developed. Overall, the obtained results from TD-DFT confirm the strong adsorption of H2O2 on the graphitic N positions of the N-CDs. The laminated three-dimensional (3D)-μPAD featuring a 6 mm circular detection zone was fabricated using a simple wax screen printing technique. Classification of TC according to the clinically relevant criteria (healthy, <5.2 mM; borderline, 5.2-6.2 mM; and high risk, >6.2 mM) could be determined by the naked eye within 10 min by simple comparison using a color chart.

Thus, a method for converting this abundant source of biomass to useful chemicals, such as lactic acid, would be beneficial. In this study, we determined the catalytic activities of various metal oxides for chitin conversion at 533 K and found that MgO showed the highest activity for lactic acid production. X-ray diffraction analysis and thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis showed that the MgO was transformed to Mg(OH)2 during chitin conversion. The highest yield of lactic acid (10.8 %) was obtained when the reaction was carried out for 6 h with 0.5 g of the MgO catalyst.

Rapidly ascertaining the G6PD status of a person is desirable for proper treatment. The device described in this study, the G6PD diaxBOX, was developed to quantify G6PD deficiency using paper-based analytical devices (PADs) and a colorimetric assay. The G6PD diaxBOX is a straightforward, affordable, portable, and instrument-free analytical system.

When NADPH is generated, it absorbs at UV 340 nm and emits colored light that is detected with the camera. The determined Pearson's coefficient shows that the color intensity measured from the G6PD diaxBOX correlated with G6PD activity level. Also, a Bland-Altman analysis indicated that more than 95% of the measurement error was in the upper and lower boundaries (±2 SD) and the error from the severe and moderate deficiency group was less than ± 1 SD. Therefore, the error from G6PD diaxBOX was within the limit boundary and the overall accuracy was more than 80%.

Herein, a hollow capillary channel was constructed via laser engraved micropatterning functions as a micropump to facilitate viscous fluidic transport, which would otherwise impede analysis on paper devices. Using salivary thiocyanate as a model analyte, the proposed device was found to exhibit a promising sensing ability on paper devices without the need for sample pretreatment or bulky instrumentation, as normally required in conventional methods used for saliva analysis. An extensive linear dynamic range covering detection of salivary thiocyanate for both high and trace level regimes (5 orders of magnitude working range) was collectively achieved using the dual-sensing modes. Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection was 6 μmol L−1 with a RSD of less than 5%. An excellent stability for the μpumpPAD was also observed for over 30 days. Real sample analysis using the proposed device was found to be in line with the standard chromatographic method. Benefitting from simple fabrication and operation, portability, disposability, low sample volume (20 μL), and low cost (< 1 USD), the μpumpPAD is an exceptional alternative tool for the detection of various biomarkers in saliva specimens.

Although chitin, a main component of the shells of crustaceans, can be converted to valuable products by means of homogeneous catalysis, most of the chitin is treated as industrial waste because use of homogeneous catalysts is compromised by difficulties associated with product separation from the catalysts and the recyclability of the catalysts.

Here, we report an automated paper-based eLFA device for the quantitative detection of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) - the major cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using a time-delayed microfluidic strategy fabricated on paper, an automated and precisely sequenced solution transfer was enabled by single sample loading. A gold metallization strategy was employed for the signal-on electrochemical detection of the target DNA. Furthermore, a pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (so-called \"acpcPNA\") was used as a probe in this study because it offers higher specificity and yields lower background currents than those of traditional probes.

Water in the atmosphere acts as both a reaction medium and a reductant during the ozonolysis. Inspired by the atmospheric aqueous-phase ozonolysis, we herein report the ozonolysis of alkenes in water assisted by surfactants. Several types of surfactants, including anionic, cationic, and nonionic surfactants, were investigated. Although most surfactants enhanced the solubility of alkenes in water, they also generated excessive foaming during the ozone bubbling, which led to the loss of products. Mitigation of the frothing was accomplished by using Coolade as a nonionic and low-foaming surfactant. Coolade-assisted ozonolysis of alkenes in water provided the desired carbonyl products in good yields and comparable to those achieved in organic solvents. During the ozonolysis reaction, water molecules trapped within the polyethylene glycol region of Coolade were proposed to intercept the Criegee intermediate to provide a hydroxy hydroperoxide intermediate. Decomposition of the hydroxy hydroperoxide led to formation of the carbonyl product without the need for a reductant typically required for the conventional ozonolysis using organic solvents. This study presents Coolade as an effective surfactant to improve the solubility of alkenes while mitigating frothing during the ozonolysis in water.', '© 2021 by the authors.

It has found wide applications in chemical and biosensing fields owing to its high sensitivity, robustness, small sized-design, and ease of integration with electronic measurement systems. However, it is necessary to coat QCM with a sensing film. Without coating materials, its selectivity and sensitivity are not obtained. At present, this is not an issue, mainly due to the advancement of oscillator circuits and dedicated measurement circuits. Since a new researcher may seek to understand QCM sensors, we provide an overview of QCM from its fundamental knowledge. Then, we explain some of the recent QCM applications both in gas-phase and liquid-phase. Next, the theory of QCM is introduced by using piezoelectric stress equations and the Mason equivalent circuit, which explains how the QCM behavior is obtained. Then, the conventional equations that govern QCM behaviors in terms of resonant frequency and resistance are described. We show the behavior of QCM with a viscous film based on the acoustic wave equation and Mason equivalent circuit. Then, we present various existing QCM electronic measurement methods. Furthermore, we describe the experiment on QCM with viscous loading and its interpretation based on the Mason equivalent circuit.

The characterization confirmed that a nanocomposite hydrogel structure of TiO2/MXene-PVA/GO was formed. The as-prepared hydrogel substantially enhanced the sensor performances due to electrocatalytic activity of TiO2, high conductivity of MXene, and auto-sample preconcentration via PVA/GO hydrogel. The electrochemical behavior of NE was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. Under optimized conditions, the TiO2/MXene-PVA/GO hydrogel/SPCE response due to the oxidation of NE at +0.4 V (vs. Ag|AgCl) is proportional to the concentration of NE over 0.01 to 1.00 μM (R2 = 0.9968) and 1.00 to 60.0 μM (R2 = 0.9936) ranges with a detection limit (3σ) of 6 nM without interferent effect from common interferences in urine. Furthermore, this sensor was employed for urinary NE determination and validated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a UV detector at 280 nm; the average recovery was found to be 97.6 to 102%, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) less than 4.9%.

The cocktail solution of the optode was composed of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-octyloxyphenyl)porphyrin cobalt(II) complex (L), tridodecylmethylammonium chloride (TDMACl), 2-nitrophenyl octyl ether, and polyvinyl chloride as an ionophore, an ion exchanger, a plasticizer, and a polymer, respectively. The paper-based optode responded to thiocyanate by increasing the blue component in the RGB index and a visible change, with the naked-eye, of the optode color from pink to green was observed. From the central composite design, the optimized conditions that yielded the highest sensitivity were 4.70 mmol/kg TDMACl and 13.75 mmol/kg L. The developed optode sensor was highly selective and responded to thiocyanate over other anions, with a working range of 0.001–5 mM and with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9915. The limits of detection using naked-eye and camera were determined to be 50.0 μM and 1.26 μM, respectively. In addition, the LOD and LOQ estimated from the standard deviation of the blank were 0.65 and 1.87 μM, respectively. Furthermore, this sensor was successfully applied to the detection of thiocyanate in urine samples from non-smokers and smokers. The results were in good agreement with the standard ion chromatography (IC) technique. This developed paper-based optode sensor was simple, low-cost, portable, and easy to use as a sensing device without any complicated instrument.', '© 2021 by the authors.

This derivative showed 1:1 binding with Fe3+ in an acetonitrile-water mixture (1:9 v/v) with the binding constant (K) of 5.4 × 104 M−1 and the limit of detection of 0.58 µM. The Fe3+ complexation reaction has been proved to be a reversible process and could be effectively repeated up to three cycles. The electronic properties of BODIPY-PH and its Fe3+ complex modeled by the density functional theory (DFT) method suggested the presence of chelation-enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) effect in the Fe3+ binding reaction. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) probed at Fe K-edge confirmed the complex formation between BODIPY-PH and the Fe3+ in an octahedral geometry. Finally, bioimaging against human embryonic kidney (Hek293) cell, through confocal fluorescence microscopic technique indicated that the BODIPY-PH displayed good permeability and low toxicity toward the tested cell lines and showed enhanced fluorescent signal in the cells incubated with Fe3+ proving its capability for Fe3+ analysis in cellular matrix.', '© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently administered over-the-counter medicines to treat fever, pain and control inflammation.

Selective detection of cortisol based on a label-free electrochemical assay was achieved by specific recognition of the cortisol DNA aptamer (CApt). The CApt was modified with streptavidin magnetic beads (MBs) before simple immobilization onto the electrode surface using a neodymium magnet. The electrochemical behavior of the aptamer-based biosensor was assessed by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) (vs Ag/AgCl). The specific binding between cortisol and CApt resulted in a decrease in charge transfer resistance (Rct) from EIS using [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− with increasing cortisol concentration. Under optimal conditions, a linear range from 0.10 to 100 ng/mL with a low detection limit (3SD/slope) of 2.1 pg/mL was obtained. Furthermore, the proposed biosensing system exhibited a satisfactory recovery in the range 97.4–109.2% with 5.7–6.6% RSD in spiked artificial human sweat. Regarding the applications of this tool, the aptamer-based biosensor has potential to be a versatile and point-of-care (POC) device for simple, sensitive, selective, disposable, and low-cost cortisol detection.

Several bacteria species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, are considered to be associated with severe periodontal conditions. In this study, we demonstrated a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) immunoassay for quantitative assessment of the periodontal bacteria, A. actinomycetemcomitans. An immunosensor was constructed using a self-assembled monolayer of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (11-MUA) on the gold surface of a QCM chip. The 11-MUA layer was evaluated using a cyclic voltammetry technique to determine its mass and packing density. Next, a monoclonal antibody was covalently linked to 11-MUA using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide to act as the biorecognition element. The specificity of the monoclonal antibody was confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A calibration curve, for the relationship between the frequency shifts and number of bacteria, was used to calculate the number of A. actinomycetemcomitans bacteria in a test sample. Based on a regression equation, the lower detection limit was 800 cells, with a dynamic range up to 2.32 × 106 cells. Thus, the QCM biosensor in this study provides a sensitive and label-free method for quantitative analysis of periodontal bacteria. The method can be used in various biosensing assays for practical application and routine detection of periodontitis pathogens.', '© 2021 American Chemical Society.An improved strategy for compound identification incorporating gas chromatography hyphenated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy (GC-FTIR/MS) is reported. (Over)reliance on MS may lead either to ambiguous identity or to incorrect identification of a compound. However, the MS result is useful to provide a cohort of possible compounds. The IR result for each tentative compound match was then simulated using molecular modeling, to provide functional group and isomer differentiation information, and then compared with the experimental FTIR result, offering identification based on both MS and IR. Several basis sets were evaluated for IR simulations; Def2-TZVPP was a suitable basis set and correlated well with experimental data. The approach was applied to industrial applications, confirming the isomers of 2,3-bis(thiosulfanyl)-but-2-enedinitrile, bromination products of 1-bromo-2,3-dimethylbenzene, and autoxidative degradation of phenyl-di-tert-butylphosphine.', '© The Author(s) 2021.Isoxazoline derivatives of the natural products eugenol, 1’-S-acetoxychavicol acetate and sclareol are prepared through 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions in an aqueous buffered system.

Compounds 2, 2a and 3f display strong antitubercular activity with minimum inhibitory concentration values of 26.68, 17.89 and 14.58 µM, respectively. Furthermore, derivative 3f exhibits antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus (minimum inhibitory concentration value of 29.16 µM). Isoxazoline derivatives of 1’-S-acetoxychavicol acetate demonstrate improvements in cytotoxicity, and derivative 3f of sclareol demonstrates improved antitubercular and antibacterial activities.

Although NTE behaviors have been found in kinds of compounds, it remains challenging for polymers to achieve intrinsic NTE property. In this work, we systematically studied the conformational change of dibenzocyclooctadiene (DBCOD) derivatives between chair (C) and twist-boat (TB) forms based on density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, and found clear evidence of the relationship between the structure of DBCOD units and the thermal contraction behavior of the related polymers. In order to obtain the polymer with NTE property, two conditions should be met for the thermal contracting DBCOD related units as follows: (i) the TB conformation can turn into C conformation as the temperature increases, and (ii) the volume of C conformation is smaller than that of TB conformation. This rule should offer a guidance to exploration of the new intrinsic NTE polymers in the future.', '© 2021 Elsevier B.V.A total integrated electrocolorimetric sensing approach consisting of gel-based electromembrane extraction and colorimetric detection in a one-step process was developed. This system was designed using colorimetric reagents preadded to the agarose gel for the determination of the following two model analytes: iodide and hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)]. In this system, when a voltage was applied, the analytes were extracted and transferred from the sample solution (donor phase) to the gel (acceptor phase). The analytes then simultaneously reacted with the colorimetric reagents inside the gel, yielding blue and violet colors for iodide and Cr(VI), respectively. These colors were then analyzed using a portable spectrometer and could also be distinguished with the naked eye. Parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were studied and optimized for both analytes. The gel composition for iodide detection was 4% (w/v) agarose, 5% (v/v) H2O2, and 1% (w/v) starch in 2 mM HCl. The gel composition for Cr(VI) detection was 2% (w/v) agarose and 1% (w/v) DPC in 0.5 mM HNO3. Both analytes were extracted at an applied potential of 50 V, an extraction time of 15 min and a stirring rate of 600 rpm. Under the optimized conditions, the developed systems provided linear responses within 15 min for iodide concentrations ranging from 50 to 250 μg L−1 with a detection limit of 18 μg L−1 and for Cr(VI) concentrations ranging from 30 to 125 μg L−1 with a detection limit of 5 μg L−1. Finally, these systems were successfully applied to the determination of iodide in iodide food supplement samples and Cr(VI) in drinking water samples, showing a negligible matrix effect. This integration could also be extended to other analytes and detection systems to develop sensitive, on-site, and environmentally friendly sensing approaches.', \"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.A label-free electrochemical immunosensor based on polyaniline (PANI) micellar electrode was firstly fabricated for direct AMH detection. To control the size regularity of PANI, a micelle-based method using ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS) as a reducing agent was employed in the polymerization process. The Anti-AMH antibodies were readily immobilized onto PANI via peptide bond to enhance the sensor specificity and sensitivity. This sensor was applied for the detection of AMH, an ovarian response indicator in female related to residual eggs during a woman's monthly cycle. The sensor performances were systematically investigated by differential pulse voltammetry. The anodic peak current decreases with the increase of AMH concentration owing to blocking of electron transfer by AMH. Under the optimal conditions, this sensor offers high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 0.1 ng mL−1 and a wide linear range of 0.1–4 ng mL−1, which is sensitive enough to indicate the ability to produce eggs during a woman's monthly cycle. Furthermore, this system requires lower sample volume (5 μL), while offers the simple fabrication with low cost and no synthetic challenge and faster analysis compared with a standard ELISA. Ultimately, this sensor was successfully applied for the detection of AMH in human serum with satisfactory results. Thus, it might be an alternative tool for AMH screening in clinical setting.\", '© 2021, Springer Nature B.V.Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is carried out using silver nitrate as a silver precursor and sugarcane leaves extract containing phenolic compound as reducing agents. Effect of sugarcane leaves extraction temperature, i.e., room temperature, 60° and 90 °C on phenolic compound content was investigated. The characteristics of the as-synthesized AgNPs were studied by UV–Vis spectrophotometer, XRD, FTIR and TEM confirming the formation of AgNPs with an average particle size of 16.9 ± 4.7 nm. The AgNPs were further evaluated as ammonia and hydrogen peroxide solution sensing. The results revealed that the developed AgNPs using green synthesis had an ability to detect hydrogen peroxide and ammonia for relatively low concentration which can be observed by both UV–Vis spectrophotometer and naked eye. Moreover, the results also revealed the detectability of AgNPs to those toxic agents after storage for 14 days. The results indicated that the green synthesis of AgNPs is value-added to the agricultural waste, for example, sugarcane leaves which can be further applied for bio-sensors of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide sensing.', '© 2021 American Chemical SocietyDiethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) labeling analyzed with mass spectrometry can provide important insights into higher order protein structures. It has been previously shown that neighboring hydrophobic residues promote a local increase in DEPC concentration such that serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues are more likely to be labeled despite low solvent exposure. In this work, we developed a Rosetta algorithm that used the knowledge of labeled and unlabeled serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues and assessed their local hydrophobic environment to improve protein structure prediction. Additionally, DEPC-labeled histidine and lysine residues with higher relative solvent accessible surface area values (i.e., more exposed) were scored favorably. Application of our score term led to reductions of the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of the lowest scoring models. Additionally, models that scored well tended to have lower RMSDs. A detailed tutorial describing our protocol and required command lines is included.

However, dedicated laboratory ozone generators are quite expensive equipment and may not be affordable by many laboratories. Recently, low-cost ozone disinfectors have become more common as a household appliance. Herein, we demonstrate the applicability of a household ozone disinfector, which can produce ozone in the order of 10 mmol/h, as alternative equipment for the laboratory scale ozonolysis of alkenes. The ozonolysis of 14 styrene derivatives bearing electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings including those with α- and β-substituents, as well as 8 natural products containing olefinic moieties were investigated. Ozonolysis of these alkenes at millimole scales proceeded to completion within 30–40 minutes and the carbonyl products were obtained in 68% to quantitative yields. Preparative-scale ozonolysis of 4-methoxystyrene (6.17 g, 46 mmol) was also demonstrated. The reaction proceeded smoothly to yield 4-anisaldehyde in 92% yield, which was subsequently converted to p-anisaldehyde dimethyl acetal in 66% yield. This work presents household ozone disinfector as an affordable, compact size, and practical synthetic equipment that does not require extra modification. Thus, the household ozone disinfector offers convenient access to ozonolysis or other reactions involving ozone for low-budget laboratories.', '© 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are formed by a series of chemical reactions initiated by non-enzymatic glycation reactions, in which reducing sugars are attached to the free amino groups of proteins.

SPEs are functionalized with antibodies specific for IL-6 through electrodeposition of a diazonium linking group and N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) coupling, which was tracked through the use of cyclic voltammetry and Raman spectroscopy. The functionalized SPEs are mounted inside an additively manufactured flow cell and connected to the HTM device. We demonstrate the ability to detect IL-6 at clinically relevant concentrations in PBS buffer (pH = 7.4) with no significant interference from the similarly sized sepsis-related biomarker procalcitonin (PCT). The limit of detection (3s) of the system is calculated to correspond to 3.4 ± 0.2 pg mL-1 with a working range spanning the physiologically relevant concentration levels in both healthy individuals and patients with sepsis, indicating the sensitivity of the sensor is suitable for the application. Further experiments helped provide a proof-of-application through the detection of IL-6 in blood plasma with no significant interference observed from PCT or the constituents of the medium. Due to the selectivity, sensitivity, straightforward operation, and low cost of production, this sensor platform has the potential for use as a traffic light sensor for the multidetection of inflammatory biomarkers for the diagnosis of sepsis and other conditions in which the rapid testing of blood biomarkers has vital clinical application.\", '© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.The electrochemical determination of five heavy metals is demonstrated using a wireless and card-sized potentiostat coupled with a smartphone through near-field communication (NFC) technology. A smartphone application was customized to command the NFC potentiostat, collect real-time signals, process the data, and ultimately display the quantities of the selected elements. The screen-printed graphene electrode (SPGE) was simply fabricated and modified using different nanomaterials for each heavy metal. Using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) mode on the smartphone, the signal peaks were presented at + 10 mV for As(III), + 350 mV for Cr(VI), 0 mV for Hg(II), − 900 mV for Cd(II), and − 680 mV vs. Ag/AgCl for Pb(II). The linear ranges were 25−500, 250−25,000, 100−1,500, 25−750, 25−750 ng mL−1 with detection limits of 3.0, 40, 16, 2.0, and 0.95 ng mL−1 for As(III), Cr(VI), Hg(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II), respectively. The reproducibility in terms of relative standard deviation was less than 8.8% (n = 5 devices) of the developed SPGE coupled with the NFC potentiostat. Various samples for different applications (e.g., food safety and environmental monitoring) were analyzed and quantified using the proposed sensors. The results from this sensor indicate that there is no significant difference (95% confidence level) compared with those obtained from the traditional ICP–OES method, while the recoveries were found in the acceptable range of 80–111%. Hence, it can be deduced that this recent advanced technology of the NFC potentiostat developed for heavy metal analysis offers a highly sensitive and selective detection, yet the sensor remains compact, low-cost, and readily accessible to end-users.

In this study, the effects of metal dopants on the physicochemical properties of metal-doped CN samples (Fe-, Cu-, Zn-, FeCu-, FeZn-, and CuZn-doped CN) and their catalytic activity in the photooxidation of acetic acid were investigated and discussed for their correlation, especially on their surface and bulk structures. The materials in the order of highest to lowest photocatalytic activity are FeZn_CN, FeCu_CN, Fe_CN, and Cu_CN (rates of CO2 evolution higher than for CN), followed by Zn_CN, CuZn_CN, and CN (rates of CO2 evolution lower than CN). Although Fe doping resulted in the extension of the light absorption range, incorporation of metals did not significantly alter the crystalline phase, morphology, and specific surface area of the CN materials. However, the extension of light absorption into the visible region on Fe doping did not provide a suitable explanation for the increase in photocatalytic efficiency. To further understand this issue, the materials were analyzed using two complementary techniques, reversed double-beam photoacoustic spectroscopy (RDB-PAS) and electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). The FeZn_CN, with the highest electron trap density between 2.95 and 3.00 eV, afforded the highest rate of CO2 evolution from acetic acid photodecomposition. All Fe-incorporated CN materials and Cu-CN reported herein can be categorized as high activity catalysts according to the rates of CO2 evolution obtained, higher than 0.15 μmol/min−1, or >1.5 times higher than that of pristine CN. Results from this research are suggestive of a correlation between the rate of CO2 evolution via photocatalytic oxidation of acetic acid with the threshold number of free unpaired electrons in CN-based materials and high electron trap density (between 2.95 and 3.00 eV).', '© 2022 American Chemical Society.

The platform allows users to perform electrochemical measurements without interference from the convective component of fluid motion, which is unfavorable in most techniques. Users can freely transfer-switch-stop fluid flows by manually rotating the paper disk, evidencing the superior flexibility of this sensor compared to other biosensors.

This additional step can widen the LR to 0.5 pg/mL, with a LOD of 3.54 fg/mL, which is the lowest detectable level ever reported among paper-based sensors.

Meanwhile, the huge number of MOFs poses a great challenge to experimental-intensive development of high-performance functional applications. By taking the computationally feasible and structurally representative trigonal prismatic secondary building units (SBUs) of MOFs as the entry point, we introduce a descriptor-based approach for designing high-performance MOFs for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrostatic potential-derived charge (ESPC) is identified as a robust and universal OER performance descriptor of MOFs, showing a distinct linear relationship with the onset potentials of OER elemental steps. Importantly, we establish an ESPC-based physical pattern of active site-intermediate binding strength, which interprets the rationality of ESPC as an OER performance descriptor. We further reveal that the SBUs with Ni/Cu as active site atoms while Mn/Fe/Co/Ni as spectator atoms have excellent OER activity through the variation pattern of ESPC along with metal composition. The universal correlation between ESPC and OER activity provides a rational rule for designing high-performance MOF-based OER electrocatalysts and can be easily extended to design functional MOFs for a rich variety of catalytic applications.', '© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Conductive composite fibers containing poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were fabricated by emulsion electrospinning of 2,5-dibromo-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (DBEDOT) in toluene together with aqueous solution of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate followed by heat treatment at 70 °C to convert DBEDOT to conductive PEDOT via solid state polymerization (SSP).

N-CDs was synthesized using the hydrothermal method with the ethylene glycol and ammonia solution as carbon and nitrogen precursors, respectively. The detection principle was based on “off-on” fluorescence switching. Specifically, the fluorescence signal of N-CDs was first turned off after incorporating the Ag+ and Tollens’ reagents. Then, in the presence of FA, the Ag+ species on the N-CDs surface were reduced to Ag0 species and the fluorescence signal of N-CDs was switched back on. The fluorescence intensity due to the N-CDs signal linearly increased with the increasing FA concentrations in the range of 5–100 mg L−1, with the detection limit of 1.5 mg L−1.

Magnetic studies indicate that the Gd- and Dy-based compounds 1Gd, 1Dy, 3Gd, 3Dy, and 4Gd show simple paramagnetic behaviours, whereas compound 4Dy exhibits weak ferromagnetic interactions.', 'Aqueous Zn-ion batteries (ZIB) are a promising candidate owing to the low cost and abundance of Zn, two-electron transfer of Zn and direct use of Zn metal as the negative electrode (anode) for high specific capacity, and no explosion issues. Electrode materials based on metal vanadates and vanadium oxides also exhibit relatively stable cycle characteristics when applying to other metal-ion batteries, e.g., Na-ion batteries, Al-ion batteries, and ZIB. Their layer structures allow Zn ion to intercalate for stable storage. Ligand-free metal vanadate nanowires, CuV2O6 and ZnV2O6, were synthesized. The impact of nanowire morphology and transition-metal doping to synthesized vanadium oxides as the positive electrode material on the performance of rechargeable aqueous ZIB was investigated. Results revealed that both the wire morphology and Cu doping enhanced the cycle stability and specific capacity of the cathode. The improvement is ascribed to the wire morphology and Cu doping for attaining more mechanical stability, less morphology change and fewer parasitic reactions, and more facile Zn2+ insertion/extraction.', '© 2022 American Chemical Society.Pyrene-conjugated monomeric (2) and dimeric (5) shaped-silsesquioxane (SQ) cages, as chemical sensors for detecting fluoride and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were prepared by Heck-coupling reactions between vinyl-functionalized SQ cages and bromo-substituted pyrenes. These sensors give a remarkable deep-blue fluorescence, which could be quenched in the presence of fluoride and electron-withdrawing PAHs. Interestingly, both sensors 2 and 5 show a rapid detection toward PAHs, while a high number of vinylic silicon atoms in a monomeric cage-based sensor 2 detected fluoride relatively faster than a bulky dumbbell sensor 5. In addition, these sensors also provide a naked-eye color of fluoride detection through an intramolecular charge-transfer presenting in yellow and pink (λmax ∼495 and 520 nm) for mono and dumbbell sensors, respectively. The limit of detection for fluoride and PAH (e.g., 1-pyrenecarboxaldehyde and 1-nitropyrene) detections is approximately 1-3 μM. The computational calculation for the further mechanistic study of PAHs detection revealed that an emission of SQ was absorbed by PAHs, thereby resulting in aggregation-caused quenching.', '© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.A new detection strategy was developed to improve the sensitivity of a lateral flow immunoassay platform utilizing a delayed hydrophobic barrier fabricated with trimethylsilyl cellulose (TMSC). The SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 SP RBD) antigen was chosen as a model analyte to demonstrate the superior detectability of this scheme. The novel device consists of 2 separate layers, so-called delayed lateral flow immunoassay (d-LFIA). The upper layer is intended for the analyte or sample flow path, where the test solution flows freely straight to the detection zone to bind with the primary antibody. The lower layer, located just underneath, is designed for the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain-conjugated gold nanoparticles (SARS-CoV-2 SP RBD-AuNPs) used for producing a colorimetric signal. This layer is fabricated with a TMSC barrier to time-delay the movement of SARS-CoV-2 SP RBD-AuNPs, thus allowing the antigen to bind with the primary antibody more efficiently. This platform exhibited a 2.6-fold enhancement in the sensitivity and 9.1-fold improvement in the limit of detection (LOD) as compared with the conventional LFIA. In addition, this d-LFIA device was satisfactorily applied to accurate screening of COVID-19 patients. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]', '© 2022Splitter-based non-cryogenic artificial trapping (SNAT) modulation approach in comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) was developed. The system employed semi-nonpolar/polar columns, a restrictor and a microfluidic Deans switch (DS) applying periodic multiple heartcuts (H/C) and several splitters with different dimensions located between the first (1D) column outlet and the DS. These splitters enabled artificial split-and-trap process consisting of 1) systematic pulse splitting, 2) split-pulse delay and 3) the pulse combination prior to 4) periodic selective H/C of the overlapped pulse. The interval between each H/C was herein defined as a new parameter called artificial modulation period (PAM). Methods to adjust sampling time (tsamp) and PAM were described with tsamp/PAM ratios equal to numbers of the splitters (nsplit). This was demonstrated for artificial modulation of a solvent mixture with nsplit = 4 and 8 as well as separation of lighter gas, lubricant and diesel samples using the PAM range of 0.23–4.57 min. Intraday and interday percentages of relative standard deviation (%RSD) of peak areas in repeated separations of the solvent mixture (n = 15) were within the range of 0.7–12% and 4–10%, respectively. The%RSD ranges for the 1D modulated times were 0–0.2% and 0–0.09%, respectively. The established approach enables artificial split-and-trap of highly volatile compounds without cryogen consumption and use of a long second dimensional (2D) column.', '© 2022. Thieme.

As a country rich in biodiversity, chemical research in Thailand was originally founded on the study of natural products. The discovery and development of novel, biologically active agents has contributed to drug discovery and advanced the development of novel compounds.1 Since the 1990s, the growth of petrochemical industries in Southeast Asia has spurred chemical research on synthetic methodologies, the creation of high-value compounds from petroleum-based starting materials and polymer sciences. The results have led to significant economic and strategic advantages that have enabled the competitiveness of local petrochemical industries. Moving into the new era, Thailand and the region faces global sustainability challenges. Green chemistry has also become a key theme for driving chemical research, which is expected to help in generating new ideas and innovations to deliver a more sustainable society. This cluster contains 27 articles that have been submitted from 12 different Thai universities. The articles are organized into 3 main themes, as outlined below.', 'This journal is © The Royal Society of ChemistryCyclic silanol derivatives (CSDs), possessing siloxane rings consisting of T-unit silicon and oxygen atoms, are considered efficient precursors for the preparation of versatile well-defined building blocks of hybrid materials such as cyclic, cage- or ladder-type SQs. This review provides an outline of the main synthetic routes to numerous stereoregular CSDs with different sizes of siloxane rings since the first example of CSDs reported by Brown et al. in 1965. The typical reaction conditions and chemical shifts of 29Si NMR of all mentioned CSDs in this review are summarized in tables and schemes to recapitulate the state of the art. The synthesis of all-cis-cyclotetrasiloxanes (T4), the most investigated CSDs, and their functionalization by different organic reactions to access various all-cis-T4 with functional groups are methodically presented. Moreover, the potential of CSDs in multiple application fields is discussed to show the possible research directions of this family of compounds in the future.', '© 2021 Elsevier B.V.We recently reported on fixed-path length laser-induced sound pinging (FPL-LISP) as a rapid photoacoustic technique employing an inexpensive benchtop tattoo-removal laser for reliably determining the speed of sound in low-volume fluids. In this contribution, we demonstrate the capacity of FPL-LISP to analyze representative commercial beverages for their natural or artificial sweetener contents. As a benchmark, the speed of sound was determined for solutions of sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose), mock high fructose corn syrup (HFCS-55), and 12 household sweeteners (culinary sugars, syrups, honey, molasses) across the concentration range of 1–20% w/v in water, simulating the typical sweetener range found in commercial soft drinks. The setup was then employed to estimate sweetener contents of 26 popular commercial beverages using the HFCS-55 standard curve as a training data set. Our results are remarkably consistent with the label values for these representative commercial beverages, in spite of the fact that some beverages clearly employ a sweetener other than HFCS-55 or a proprietary blend, suggesting the excellent potential of the FPL-LISP setup as a quick screening tool well-suited to quality control and real-time assessment in the beverage and fermentation industrial sectors. The proposed approach represents a significant improvement over many existing methods on the basis of measurement time (down to 1 s, which can be considered real time for many applications), lenient sample requirements (tens of microliters to 1 mL), robust and user-friendly analysis, practical considerations (e.g., economical, minimal service and maintenance concerns), and prospects for advancing both online monitoring and fully portable versions of this instrumentation.', '© 2023 American Chemical Society.Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic in early 2020, multiple variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been detected. The emergence of multiple variants has raised concerns due to their impact on public health. Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish between different viral variants. Here, we developed a machine learning web-based application for SARS-CoV-2 variant identification via duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with high-resolution melt (qPCR-HRM) analysis. As a proof-of-concept, we investigated the platform’s ability to identify the Alpha, Delta, and wild-type strains using two sets of primers. The duplex qPCR-HRM could identify the two variants reliably in as low as 100 copies/μL. Finally, the platform was validated with 167 nasopharyngeal swab samples, which gave a sensitivity of 95.2%. This work demonstrates the potential for use as automated, cost-effective, and large-scale viral variant surveillance.', '© 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Notably, RCM to form five-, six-, or eight-membered bromoolefins was unsuccessful, with the exception of one example where RCM afforded diethyl 3-bromocyclohex-3-ene-1,1-dicarboxylate. In this case, a bromomethyl-substituted cyclohexene was obtained as a byproduct. The utility of selected bromoolefin RCM products was demonstrated through their participation in Suzuki Miyaura reactions. Vinylic halide exchange (Br → Cl) was noted as a side reaction under RCM conditions.', '© 2022 American Chemical SocietyLipL32 is an outer membrane protein present only on pathogenic Leptospira species, which is the causative agent of leptospirosis. Leptospirosis symptoms are often misdiagnosed with other febrile illnesses as the clinical manifestations are non-specific. Therefore, an accurate diagnostic tool for leptospirosis is indeed critical for proper and prompt treatment. Typical diagnosis via serological assays is generally performed to assess the antibodies produced against Leptospira. However, their delayed antibody response and complicated procedure undoubtedly limit the practical utilization especially in a primary care setting. Here, we demonstrate for the first time an early-stage detection of LipL32 by an integrated lateral-flow immunoassay with an electrochemical readout (eLFIA). A ferrocene trace tag was monitored via differential pulse voltammetry operated on a smartphone-based device, thus allowing for on-field testing. A superior performance in terms of the lowest detectable limit of detection of 8.53 pg/mL and broad linear dynamic range (5 orders of magnitude) among other sensors available thus far was established. Additionally, the developed test strip provided a straightforward yet sensitive approach for diagnosis of leptospirosis using the collected human sera from patients, in which the results were comparable to the real-time polymerase chain reaction technique.', '© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, we developed a disposable electrochemical sensor with improved sensitivity for the individual and simultaneous detection of carbaryl (CBR), fenobucarb (FNB), and carbosulfan (CBS) pesticides. The device used a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) modified with a nanocomposite comprising manganese dioxide nanoparticles (MnO2) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). We prepared the MnO2-GNPs nanocomposite by an in-situ growth method. The product was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The disposable sensor was fabricated by inhouse-printing using only carbon ink on inexpensive transparency paper. We investigated the electrochemical performance of the developed sensor by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The MnO2 and GNPs nanocomposite shows the highest electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of carbamate when in its phenol form. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the proposed strategy possess a good linear response of the disposable sensor for the individual determination of CBR, FNB and CBS in the concentration range of 1-40 μM, 5-150 μM and 50-600 μM with the low detection limit of 0.30 μM, 1.30 μM, 14.90 μM, respectively. Besides, the analytical performance of the proposed sensor for the simultaneous detection of CBR, FNB, and CBS exhibits a linear response in ranges of 1–30 µM, 5–80 µM, and 50–400 µM, with the limit of detection being 0.30, 1.40, and 15.15 µM, respectively. In addition, the sensor displays high reproducibility, repeatability, and good selectivity.

This developed electrochemical sensor is a promising high-sensitivity tool for fast, easy-to-use, low-cost electrochemical detection of multi-pesticide residues in agricultural samples.', '© 2022 Authors. All rights reserved.Leptospirosis is one of the most life-threatening tropical diseases caused by pathogenic Leptospira. To date, a diagnostic device that offers rapid and sensitive detection of leptospires has been still in demand for proper treatment to reduce the mortality rate. Herein, we create a resistance-based lateral flow immunosensor diagnosis device (R-LFI) that integrates near-field communication (NFC) with a portable smartphone for leptospiral detection in clinical samples. A specific monoclonal antibody against the pathogen was coated on a nitrocellulose membrane (NCM) where the test line was collocated. Two electrodes with a sandwich-like configuration were installed employing a conductive double-sided adhesive tape and connected with a NFC smartphone-based detection system. A half-sandwich immunocomplex formation induced high proton conduction, resulting in a considerable decrement in resistive response. The performance of the R-LFI sensor was evaluated using recombinant LipL32 (rLipL32), Leptospira interrogans, and clinical samples. The R-LFI device exhibited linear responses toward rLipL32 protein in phosphate buffer and L. interrogans-spiked healthy human serum samples within the concentration ranging from 1 to 1000 ng mL-1(limit of detection (LOD): 0.29 ng mL-1) and from 104to 106cell mL-1(LOD: 4.89 × 103cell mL-1), respectively. Our R-LFI sensor successfully detected L. interrogans-positive clinical samples as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This platform offers high specificity, selectivity, simplicity, miniscule sample volume, and no labeling element requirement. These desirable features make it particularly suitable for countries where medical facilities and resources are limited.', '© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHWe report the synthesis, crystal structures, and properties of three lanthanide(III) coordination complexes based on 2-thiopheneacrylic acid (Htpa) of the formula [Ln(tpa)3(H2O)3] ⋅ 3(Htpa) (Ln=Tb (1), Dy (2), Er (3)). The complexes were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, IR, TGA, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Structural analysis indicates that all three complexes are isostructural and crystallize in the trigonal space group R3. The structures of these complexes consist of a discrete neutral mononuclear species [Ln(tpa)3(H2O)3] and the Htpa molecule. In the crystal, the complex species are self-assembled into a one-dimensional (1D) supramolecular chain through classical O−H⋅⋅⋅O hydrogen bonds existing between water molecules and carboxylate oxygen atoms. The adjacent chains are further joined together by C−H⋅⋅⋅π hydrogen bonds involving the thiophene moieties, resulting in the formation of a 3D supramolecular framework. The frameworks feature 1D channels with a dimeter of ca. 1.5 nm that can accommodate Htpa molecules to allow the formation of cocrystals via strong hydrogen bonds. In addition, the solid-state luminescence and thermal properties of these complexes were also investigated.', '© 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

The key synthetic step involved a [2+2]-cycloaddition/retro-cycloaddition between an electron-rich diarylethyne and electron-deficient tetracyanoethene. The compound bearing two sulfonamide groups showed good selectivity toward hydrogen sulfide ion, with a detection limit of 15.5 μM.

The large surface area and the presence of two metals in V-porous Co3O4 contributed to its excellent catalytic activity toward 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 3,3′,5,5′- tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) with Michaelis-Menten constants (KM) of 0.1301 and 0.0141 mM, respectively. The 2D-μPAD was fabricated using simple wax screen-printing and cutting techniques. The colorimetric reactions of both glucose and TC on 2D-μPAD were simultaneously performed by adding a single drop of a whole blood sample on the sample zone made of the LF1 membrane. After the enzymatic reactions, the generated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was oxidized by V-porous Co3O4 to produce hydroxy radicals (•OH), inducing ABTS and TMB to generate colored products. The generated H2O2 was proportional to the intensities of the green and blue products of the glucose and TC systems, respectively. The developed 2D-μPAD required a short analysis time (∼5 min) with small volumes of samples (15 μL of whole blood) whereby no sample preparation was needed. Owing to several advantages including simplicity, low cost, long-term stability, and simultaneous readout, the novel V-porous Co3O4 coupled with 2D-μPAD proved to be promising for practical uses as a pioneering portable device for the determination of glucose, TC, and other important biomarkers without the need of technical supports.', '© 2022 Elsevier B.V.We report automated fabrication of solid-contact sodium-selective (Na+-ISEs) and potassium-selective electrodes (K+-ISEs) using a 3D printed liquid handling robot controlled with Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The printing system is affordable and can be customized for the use with micropipettes for applications such as drop-casting, biological assays, sample preparation, rinsing, cell culture, and online analyte monitoring using multi-well plates. The robot is more compact (25 × 30 × 35 cm) and user-friendly than commercially available systems and does not require mechatronic experience. For fabrication of ion-selective electrodes, a carbon black intermediate layer and ion-selective membrane were successively drop-cast on the surface of stencil-printed carbon electrode using the dispensing robot. The 3D-printed robot increased ISE robustness while decreasing the modification time by eliminating manual steps. The Na+-ISEs and K+-ISEs were characterized for their potentiometric responses using a custom-made, low-cost (<$25) multi-channel smartphone-based potentiometer capable of signal processing and wireless data transmission. The electrodes showed Nernstian responses of 58.2 ± 2.6 mV decade−1 and 56.1 ± 0.7 mV decade−1 for Na+ and K+, respectively with an LOD of 1.0 × 10−5 M. We successfully applied the ISEs for multiplexed detection of Na+ and K+ in urine and artificial sweat samples at clinically relevant concentration ranges. The 3D-printed pipetting robot cost $100 and will pave the way for more accessible mass production of ISEs for those who cannot afford the expensive commercial robots.', '© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.There has been a rise in pesticide use as a result of the growing industrialization of agriculture. Organophosphorus pesticides have been widely applied as agricultural and domestic pest control agents for nearly five decades, and they remain as health and environmental hazards in water supplies, vegetables, fruits, and processed foods causing serious foodborne illness. Thus, the rapid and reliable detection of these harmful organophosphorus toxins with excellent sensitivity and selectivity is of utmost importance. Aptasensors are biosensors based on aptamers, which exhibit exceptional recognition capability for a variety of targets. Aptasensors offer numerous advantages over conventional approaches, including increased sensitivity, selectivity, design flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. As a result, interest in developing aptasensors continues to expand. This paper discusses the historical and modern advancements of aptasensors through the use of nanotechnology to enhance the signal, resulting in high sensitivity and detection accuracy. More importantly, this review summarizes the principles and strategies underlying different organophosphorus aptasensors, including electrochemical, electrochemiluminescent, fluorescent, and colorimetric ones.

Aniline boronic acid was used as the only reducing agent of silver nitrate and equally oxidized to PABA based on in situ chemical oxidative polymerization. In the presence of gum tragacanth (GT), hydroxyl groups of GT will bind to PABA at boronic groups to generate the PABA/GT matrix, on which AgNPs are anchored. At the optimal synthesis, absorption spectra at 285 and 421 nm correspond to π -π* transitions of PABA and plasmon resonance band of small sized AgNPs (10–15 nm). Based on the FTIR spectrum, GT is the major constituent of nanocomposite. Under optimal conditions (40 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.0, 150 mM sodium chloride, reaction time of 8 min at room temperature), the PABA/GT@AgNPs was used as a sensing of Hg2+ based on Hg2+ induced transmetalation on arylboronic acid group and redox reaction with Ag0. In the presence of Hg2+, the aggregation of PABA/GT@AgNPs can be seen by a color change from pale yellow to colorless and a blue shift from 407 nm to 370 nm. Good linear ranges in the concentrations of 0.005–1.0 μM and 1.0–40.0 μM were achieved, with a detection limit of 0.85 nM. The practicality of the detection was demonstrated on tap and lake water samples, with no effects of other interfering ions, and satisfactory recoveries of 97–101 % and precisions of 2.9–5.6 %.', '© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Cadmium ion (Cd (II)) is a highly toxic heavy metal usually found in natural water. Exposure to Cd (II) can produce serious effects in human organs such as Itai-Itai disease. Therefore, the maximum allowance levels of Cd (II) in drinking water and herbal medicines imposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) are 3 μg L−1 and 300 μg kg−1, respectively. In this work, nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) as a fluorescent sensor for Cd (II) determination was developed in both solution-based and paper-based systems. N-GQDs were synthesized from citric acid (CA) and ethylenediamine (EDA) via the hydrothermal method. The synthesized N-GQDs emitted intense blue fluorescence with a quantum yield (QY) of up to 80%. The functional groups on the surface of N-GQDs measured by FTIR were carboxyl (COO−), hydroxyl (OH−), and amine (NH2) groups, suggesting that they could be bound to Cd (II) for complexation. The fluorescence intensity of N-GQDs was gradually enhanced with the increase of Cd (II) concentration. This phenomenon was proved to result from the fluorescence enhancement (turn-on) based on the chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) mechanism. Under the optimum conditions in the solution-based and paper-based systems, the limits of detection (LODs) were found to be 1.09 and 0.59 μg L−1, respectively. Furthermore, the developed sensors showed relatively high selectivity toward Cd (II) over ten other metal cations and six other anions of different charges. The performance of the sensor in real water and herbal medicine samples exhibited no significant difference as compared to the results of the validation method (ICP-OES). Therefore, the developed sensors can be used as fluorescent sensors for Cd (II) determination with high sensitivity, high selectivity, short incubation time (5 min). As such, the paper-based strategy has excellent promising potential for practical analysis of Cd (II) in water and herbal medicine samples with a trace level of Cd (II) concentrations.', '© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryIn recent years, modern appliances require high energy density with a burst power supply.

The 7.5%La-HMT showed excellent electrochemical performance due to doping of rare-earth La3+ metal ions, resulting in improvised active sites and reduction in the equivalent resistance. The 7.5%La-HMT operated at a high potential window (0 to −1.2 V) with an ultra-high specific capacitance (Sp) of 1226.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with capacitance retention of 89.3% over 1000 cycles.

The complexation abilities of CNT-RB with metal ions including Cu2+, Hg2+, Al3+, and Au3+ ions were investigated using DFT calculations. The interactions between metal ions and CNT-RB were also investigated. The calculated results point out that CNT-RB displays the strongest complexation ability with Au3+ ion compared with Cu2+, Hg2+, and Al3+ ions. The electronic properties reveal that after CNT-RB forms complexes with Au3+, the energy gap of CNT-RB is clearly modified. Subsequently, the CNT-RB was synthesized via an amidation reaction of carboxylic acid functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNT-COOH) and rhodamine B-ethylenediamine (RB) in the addition of N-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide as coupling reagents.

Experimental results are in good agreement with the computed results in which CNT-RB nanosensor displays high selectivity and sensitivity for Au3+ ion over the other metal ions.

CeO2 preparation started from a cerium hydrogen carbonate precursor using a range of different hydrothermal temperatures (HT) from 120 to 180°C. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and H2-temperature-programmed reduction data indicated that CeO2 morphology varied with the HT, and was composed of the more active (200) surface. Following Au deposition onto the CeO2 support, this active crystal plane resulted in the most widely dispersed Au nanoparticles on the CeO2 support. The catalytic performance of the CeO2-supported Au catalysts for both oxidation reactions improved as the reducibility increased to generate lattice oxygen vacancies and the number of adsorbed peroxide species on the CeO2 support increased due to addition of Au. The Au catalyst on the CeO2 support prepared at 120°C was the most active in both propene/toluene/CO oxidation and independent CO oxidation.', '© 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

The synthesis and fabrication of CZO thin films by various techniques have been reported, but the sol-gel technique for both spin and dip coating has attracted much attention due to its safety, low cost and simple deposition equipment on a large surface-area. Motivated by the fact that reviews on CZO thin films have not been reported yet, this review summarizes the main chemical processes used in the fabrication of CZO thin films with special focus on the sol-gel synthesis involving several chemical and physical parameters such as solvent, additive, solution stirring and aging time, substrate and coating method which includes both dip and spin coating. It also highlights the various parameters influencing the structural, morphological, electronic, optical, vibrational and magnetic properties of the CZO thin films. For this purpose, a summary of various parameters of CZO thin films, reported in the literature survey of the past ten years (2010–2020), is tabulated and discussed. The influence of Cu doping on the synthesis and properties of CZO thin films is also reviewed. The structural, electronic, optical, magnetic and vibrational properties, as well as the elemental composition and surface morphology of the CZO thin films are also discussed. At the end of this review, an outlook is presented to gain more insights into the combined effects of the method-preparation-dopant combination on the properties of CZO thin films for future potential applications.

A PtSWCNT-modified paper-based screen-printed graphene electrode was successfully developed to diagnose hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The hepatitis C virus core antigen (HCV-cAg) level was determined by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) using [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− as a redox solution. In the presence of HCV-cAg, the DPV current response decreased with increasing HCV-cAg concentration. Under the optimal conditions, the change in current response provides a good linear correlation with the logarithm of HCV-cAg concentration in the range 0.05 to 1000 pg mL−1 (RSD < 5%), and the limit of detection was 0.015 pg mL−1 (or 0.71 fmol L−1). Furthermore, the proposed immunosensor has been utilized to quantify HCV-cAg in human serum samples with reliable results compared with standard immunoassays (% relative error < 10%). This sensor offers a simple, sensitive, selective, disposable, and inexpensive means for determination of HCV-cAg in human serum samples. The paper-based label-free immunosensor is versatile and feasible for clinical diagnosis.

For the first time, the effect of the presence of three types of complexing agents such as phenanthroline (Phen), crown ethers (12C4, 15C5, 18C6), and ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) on the extraction efficiency of zinc ions was studied. In addition, the electroendosmosis (EEO) flow as an unwanted actuator was monitored in the presence and absence of complexing agents. By applying 50 V electrical potential across the membrane, the positive charged Zn2+ ions were migrated from a donor phase (pH 5.0) through the agarose gel membrane (pH 5.0, containing a complexing agent) into the acceptor phase (pH 3.0). The obtained results showed that the highest extraction recoveries were obtained when crown ethers, especially 1% (w/v) 18C6 was added to the gel membrane. In addition, EEO flow was decreased in the presence of all complexing agents (except EDTA), probably due to the increase in electrical resistance. Using the optimum conditions, the limit of detection (LOD), the limit of quantification (LOQ), and extraction recovery% (ER%) were 5.0 μg L−1, 15.0 μg L−1, and 92.5%, respectively. In the end, the applicability of the developed approach was successfully evaluated to determine Zn2+ in tap, mineral, and river water samples.', '© 2022 American Chemical Society.

Control experiments and density functional theory computations reveal the importance of the 2-hydroxy group of the ene-aldimine and attractive (e.g., OH···O, CH···O, CH···π, and π···π) interactions for high enantioselectivity (up to 74% ee). The results contribute to the design of asymmetric catalysis for the rearrangement of highly reactive iminium intermediates.', '© 2022 The Author(s)The increasing interest in the development of rapid and efficient liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) approaches has led to a strong demand of fast, portable and decentralized detection methods as compelling alternatives to standard chromatographic and atomic spectrometric techniques. For this purpose, the coupling of LPME to electrochemical detection (ECD), including mostly cyclic, differential pulse, and stripping voltammetric techniques, has been explored in recent years for sensing of various analytes, including ions and drugs, in samples of varying matrix complexity. This review is aimed at critically surveying the current state of the art of the LPME-ECD hyphenation within the timeframe of 2010–2022 by pinpointing (i) smart configurations for in-situ micro-extraction and detection, (ii) experimental parameters for amelioration of analyte extractability and detectability, (iii) the compatibility of the solvent and analyte-enriched phase with the ensuing detection step, and (iv) analytical strategies and guidelines to cope with sensitivity, and selectivity demands.

A one-pot synthesis of glycosyl chlorides is warranted as an alternative method. Here, we report a one-pot synthesis of glycosyl chlorides from thioglycoside precursors. The transformation was mediated at low temperatures by bromodiethylsulfonium bromopentachloroantimonate (BDSB) as a mild oxidant with Bu4NCl as an additive. Armed thioglycosides afforded the corresponding α-glycosyl chlorides in moderate to good yields under the optimized conditions. Low conversions and yields were obtained when the less-reactive disarmed thioglycosides were used. Unexpectedly, BDSB-mediated oxidation of thioglycosides without the addition of Bu4NCl also afforded the α-glycosyl chlorides in moderate yields. We suggest a mechanism involving the transfer of chloride ions from the nonnucleophilic bromopentachloroantimonate (SbCl5Br) anion to the oxocarbenium ion.', '© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbHThis study was focused on a facile synthesis and comprehensive characterization of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-based hydrogel and their potential absorption. CMC reacted with AlIII as an ionic crosslinker to produce physical hydrogels with better gel strength but gave a low water absorption (WAC). To elucidate this question, we fabricated both the CMC hydrogel and its nanocomposite hydrogel incorporating nano-size calcium carbonate (NCC) particles using a two-step process. The AlIII- crosslinked CMC hydrogel was subsequently filled with NCC particles to give CMC/NCC nanocomposite hydrogels. The CMC/NCC1 hydrogel with NCC 1 %wv−1 gave a three-fold higher equilibrium WAC. To achieve an insight structure-property-function relation, CMC hydrogels were characterized for physically crosslinking interaction. FT-IR confirmed that AlIII ion reacts with the negative charges of carboxylate groups on the CMC chains to form the network structure via bidentate coordination. XPS data of the CMC hydrogels agreed well with the spectroscopic data. The resonance peaks of the C−O of substituent groups−CH2COO− were shifted upward to 177.9 ppm due to the incorporation of NCC. The higher chain flexibility (low tanδ) in CMC/NCC hydrogel with NCC 1 %wv−1 produced the higher WAC than did the composite hydrogel with NCC 5 %wv−1 adding. The CMC hydrogels were explored whether they are promisingly sustainable adsorbent for dye adsorption from Sappan wood extract while its CMC/NCC hydrogel rendered for better water absorption. Morphological studies revealed that NCC particles distributed mostly on the CMC surfaces to produce nanostructured composites with some particles penetrating through hydrogel pores. The specific surface areas of the CMC hydrogel increased with NCC amounts with lower WACs due to gel stiffness. The CMC hydrogels were confirmed as a promisingly sustainable adsorbent for dye adsorption from Sappan wood extract while its CMC/NCC hydrogel rendered for better water absorption which should be applicable for the dye concentration before CMC hydrogel dye adsorption.', '© 2022Cu2+ is the third most prevalent transition metal ion in critical biological systems, although it is poisonous to humans. As a result of this, establishing a mechanism for selectively detecting the Cu2+ ion in an aqueous medium is crucial. A new triphenylamine-pyrenyl salicylic acid probe (Compound 3) was produced utilizing the Sonograshira reaction, the Suzuki cross-coupling process combined with a hydrolysis reaction for Cu2+ detection with a fluorescent turn-off mode. In the presence of Cu2+, Compound 3 operated as both a highly selective and highly sensitive fluorescent Cu2+ sensor in a 100% aqueous medium. Consequently, the fluorescence intensity of Compound 3 showed a strong linear relationship with the Cu2+ ion concentration in the 10 to 1000 pM range. The detection limit of the approach was 5.22 pM, which was less than the maximum Cu2+ level in drinking water, as suggested by the US Environmental Protection Agency of 19 µM. (EPA). Therefore, Compound 3 was successfully used to determine the concentration of Cu2+ in real samples.', '© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.This research presents a new series of tetrabenzoporphyrins (TBPs) bearing p-diphenylaminophenylethynyl and p-carboxylphenylethynyl groups or two p-carboxylphenylethynyl groups in a trans-fashion on a TBP core for photoelectrochemical O2 reduction. Impact of electron-donating diphenylamino and electron-withdrawing surface-anchoring carboxyl groups on photophysical and electrochemical properties of the target TBPs was experimentally and theoretically investigated in comparison with those of their benchmark analog. The results show that while the p-carboxylphenylethynyl group give an electronic contribution to the molecules by lowering energy gap, the role of the p-diphenylaminophenylethynyl group is found to be trivial. Preliminary investigation on electrochemical O2 reduction indicates significant catalytic activities of TBP-modified TiO2/fluorene-doped tin oxide electrodes at potentials of −0.2 V and −0.3 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) in a pH-neutral and ambient aqueous condition, leading to H2O2 formation. Upon photoirradiation, catalytic performance of such TBP-based electrodes is further enhanced with the optimum yield obtained when the dicarboxyl derivatives and the potential of −0.3 V vs. NHE are applied. Proposed photoinjection mechanism of the dye/TiO2 simulated by time-dependent density functional theory calculations supported the experimental results indicating the favorable role of the target TBPs as photoelectrocatalysts in the O2 reduction.', '© 2022 Korean Chemical Society, Seoul & Wiley-VCH GmbH.Synthetic reaction of a Cu(II) complex containing aniline moiety (Cu(atpa)) (atpa = N-(anthracen-9-ylmethyl)-2-((bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amino) with an excess Cu(ClO4)2 in CH3CN produced an unusual species, which was not corresponding to the original ligand atpa, Cu(ClO4)2 nor [Cu(atpa)]2+. It was proposed that the new species was generated via electron transfer between aniline-containing N-based ligand and Cu(ClO4)2, resulting in oxidative ligand cleavage. Monitoring the reaction of Cu(atpa) with Cu(ClO4)2 for a period of time revealed a gradual decrease of an active species, concomitant with the growth of a variety of organic fractions including 9-anthraldehyde and anthraquinone compounds. Cu(tpa) (Cu coordinated with tripodal amine ligand without anthracene analogue) was also detected from this reaction. This finding was indicative of an oxidative ligand cleavage via the N-dealkylation pathway. In addition to oxidative ligand cleavage, the new species was competent to oxidize other substrates such as triphenylphosphine (PPh3) as well.', 'Copyright © 2022 Phengsaart, Manositchaikul, Srichonphaisarn, Juntarasakul, Maneeintr, Jeon, Park, Tabelin, Hiroyoshi and Ito.We developed a technique called the reverse hybrid jig, an advanced physical separation technique that combines the principles of jig and flotation to separate floating plastics. This technique is a promising green technology that is more economical and environmentally friendly compared with the conventional flotation. Although the applicability of this technique to separate PP/PE have been reported, the index to illustrate the possibility of separation for the reverse hybrid jig is still not available. In this study, a reverse apparent concentration criterion (CCRA) is proposed to estimate reverse hybrid jig separation efficiency. This modified concentration criterion can be calculated using the specific gravity (SG) of particle with attached bubbles called the apparent specific gravity (SGA). To determine the volume of attached bubbles on plastic surfaces under water pulsation, a laser-assisted apparatus was used under various conditions, including plastic type, air flow rate, dosage, and type of wetting agent. The results of attached bubble volume measurements were used to calculate the SGA and CCRA. The estimated values were then compared with the results of reverse hybrid jig separation. It was found that higher CCRA resulted in better separation efficiency. In addition, an empirical linear equation for estimating the reverse hybrid jig separation efficiency is proposed.', '© 2022 Chemical Publishing Co..

The diameter of cellulose particles was 59.92 and 392 nm as determined by TEM and particle size analysis, respectively. A solvent casting method was used to prepare nanocellulose and polymer matrix (PLLA-PEG-PLLA) in different ratios (1%, 3% and 5% wt). It was found that the nanocellulose content, thermal and mechanical properties of the polymer matrix were varied. There was slightly increased thermal stability from 270 to 276 ºC in the first stages. In the 2nd stage from 367 to 376 ºC, TGA indicated slightly decreased Tg and Tcc while Tm was not different (DSC). The mechanical properties of biocomposite film displayed slightly increased Young’s modulus (414-447 MPa), stress at break (26-31 MPa) and elongation at break (6.6-7.6%) compared to pure PLLA-PEG-PLLA film.', '© 2023 Elsevier B.V.An automated microfluidic electrochemical platform was developed for the rapid in-field analysis of arsenic speciation. Herein, we integrated an electrochemical sensing and microfluidic channel for the simultaneous determination of As(III) and total inorganic As (total iAs) within a single device. The platform was fabricated by assembling a gold nanoparticle-modified screen-printed graphene electrode (AuNP/SPGE) on a hydrophilic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet that was specially designed to enclose a microfluidic channel with dual flow channels for separate determination of the two species. While As(III) can be promptly detected with the AuNP/SPGE on one end, thioglycolic acid stored in glass fiber is employed on the other end to reduce As(V) before being electrochemically analyzed on the AuNP/SPGE as total iAs; the difference represents the amount of As(V). With a wireless potentiostat and a smartphone equipped with Bluetooth technology, the overall procedure can be fully automated and accomplished merely within 9 min. The linear ranges for the determination of As(III) and total iAs were found to be 50–1000 and 100–1500 ng/mL with detection limits of 3.7 and 17 ng/mL, respectively. The proposed method was validated and applied for the inorganic As speciation of various food samples with satisfactory results compared to those obtained with the standard HPLC-ICP‒MS protocol. This novel microfluidic electrochemical platform offers numerous advantages, notably for its simplicity, speed, low cost, and portability for on-site analysis, which conclusively makes it a highly promising analytical device for the speciation of inorganic arsenic.', '© 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Novel amine-incorporated zinc complex/carbon dots composites were created and used as supercapacitor electrode materials in this study. By using a one-step gamma irradiation, the amine-incorporated zinc complex/carbon dots composites were prepared from zinc acetate dihydrate, ethylenediamine, and carbon dots. The impacts of ethylenediamine and carbon dots on the performance of the supercapacitor were examined. The highest specific capacitance obtained in this work was 179.9 F g−1 along with an excellent 91 % capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. To clarify the mechanistic insights on the improved supercapacitor performance, an electrochemical analysis was performed, and it was found that amine incorporation improved the diffusion process of charge transfer, which led to better charge storage and higher capacitance. We have demonstrated that gamma irradiation is a simple and efficient method for creating electro-active materials based on amine-incorporated zinc complex/carbon dots composites for supercapacitors with improved performance and electrochemical properties.', \"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Understanding the electrochemical behavior of antibiotic drugs could help develop sensors for selective and sensitive detection at trace levels due to their importance in food safety and environmental protection. In this work, we studied and evaluated the electrochemical behavior of ceftriaxone (CEF) using a bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as the first step. Differential pulse voltammetry and Cyclic voltammetry (CV) were used in this evaluation. CV showed that CEF has an oxidation peak at 0.926 V, while oxidation takes the best place in 0.1 M H2SO4 solution as an electrolyte. On the other hand, the relationship between Ep and pH showed an equal number of protons and electrons are involved in the oxidization process, while the slope value obtained from the equation plotted between logIp and logυ (0.83) showed the diffusion-adsorption mix controlled oxidation of CEF. Using these conditions, CEF on GCE showed a linearity range between 1.0 × 10−7 and 7.5 × 10−6 M with LOD equal to 2.57 × 10−8 M. However, in order to increase the selectivity and sensitivity of GCE, a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-based sensor was developed in the next part of this work. Herein, the photopolymerization technique was chosen to design the MIP on GCE using 4-amino benzoic acid (4-ABA) as a monomer. The LODs of the standard solutions and serum sample were 1.15 × 10−17 M and 1.19 × 10−17 M, respectively, while the linear range was between 1.0 × 10−16 and 1.0 × 10−15 M. Furthermore, interference effect evaluation and imprinting factor analysis were performed with selected interfering compounds and using cefuroxime, cefdinir, ceftazidime pentahydrate, cefazolin, and cefixime to demonstrate the sensor's selectivity. Moreover, the execution of the MIP sensor was confirmed by a non-imprinted polymer-based sensor. Finally, 4-ABA/CEF@MIP-GCE was used to find out CEF in commercial serum and tap water samples precisely.\", None, '© 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.In this work, new hybrid catalysts based on molecularly dispersed nickel complexes on N-doped graphene were developed for electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR). Nickel(ii) complexes (1-Ni, 2-Ni), and a new crystal structure ([2-Ni]Me), featuring N4-Schiff base macrocycles, were synthesized and investigated for their potential in ECR. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in NBu4PF6/CH3CN solution demonstrated that the nickel complexes bearing N-H groups (1-Ni and 2-Ni) showed a substantial current enhancement in the presence of CO2, while the absence of N-H groups ([2-Ni]Me) resulted in an almost unchanged voltammogram. This indicated the necessity of the N-H functionality towards ECR in aprotic media. All three nickel complexes were successfully immobilized on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) via non-covalent interactions. All three Ni@NG catalysts exhibited satisfactory CO2-to-CO reduction in aqueous NaHCO3 solution with the faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60-80% at the overpotential of 0.56 V vs. RHE. The ECR activity of [2-Ni]Me@NG also suggested that the N-H moiety from the ligand is less important in the heterogeneous aqueous system owing to viable hydrogen-bond formation and proton donors from water and bicarbonate ions. This finding could pave the way for understanding the effects of modifying the ligand framework at the N-H position toward fine tuning the reactivity of hybrid catalysts through molecular-level modulation.', '© 2022Although copper (II) ion is essential for the human body, but an excess of Cu2+ causes damage to the human cell and is implicated in many diseases. Cu2+ is also counted among heavy metal pollutants in the environment, especially in water. Thus, a new approach towards quantifying Cu2+ ion is appealing. Here, we reported new ratiometric mixed-QDs probe for Cu2+ detection in an aqueous solution with the combined concept of ratiometric and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. This probe consists of blue Si QDs (donor) and yellow CdSe QDs (acceptor). The energy transfer from Si QDs and CdSe QDs was confirmed using the time-resolved fluorescence. The changes in the ratiometric fluorescence response of the mixed-QDs probe upon exposure to Cu2+ were studied using fluorospectrometry, while the mechanism of the Cu2+ quenching to the probe was studied using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. This approach provides a simple, fast, sensitive, selective, and accurate method with low detection limit (3.89 nmol L−1) with high selectivity to Cu2+ versus other biological and environmental relevant ions. Furthermore, this new mixed-QDs probe could be used as a naked-eye detection of Cu2+ for water samples and biological specimens with further development.', '© 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.In this work, we successfully prepared isothiocyanates in one-pot manner from the corresponding amines using carbon tetrabromide as a desulfurizing agent. The in situ formation of dithiocarbamate salts from amines followed by desulfurization using carbon disulfide provided various isothiocyanates in good to excellent yields. Moreover, our method can be extended to prepare unsymmetrical thioureas in one-pot process. Both methods are applicable to large scale synthesis. The benefits of this reaction include one-pot synthesis, mild condition, simple operation, and metal-free process.', '© 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Nowadays, food safety has become a major concern for the sustainability of global public health.

Here, we present a fully-automated system for large-scale production of ISEs. Three materials, including polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate and polyimide, were used as substrates for fabricating ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) using stencil printing, screen-printing and laser engraving, respectively. We compared sensitivities of the ISEs to determine the best material for the fabrication process of the ISEs. The electrode surfaces were modified with various carbon nanomaterials including multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon black, and their mixed suspensions as the intermediate layer to enhance sensitivities of the electrodes. An automated 3D-printed robot was used for the drop-cast procedure during ISE fabrication to eliminate manual steps. The sensor array was optimized, and the detection limits were 10–5 M, 10–5 M and 10–4 M for detection of K+, Na+ and Ca2+ ions, respectively. The sensor array integrated with a portable wireless potentiometer was used to detect K+, Na+ and Ca2+ in real urine and simulated sweat samples and results obtained were in agreement with ICP-OES with good recoveries. The developed sensing platform offers low-cost detection of electrolytes for point-of-care applications.

Nurdles can be discharged into the environment at all stages of the plastics supply chain where they are handled, including at the manufacturing site, during transportation, loading or storage, and the fabrication facility. Nurdle spillages due to maritime accidents have been frequently reported worldwide. The most recent unprecedented nurdle spillage was reported close to the western coastline of Sri Lanka when the ship MV X-Press Pearl caught fire. Nurdles can be further dispersed via wind, surface water currents, and tides, or deposited in coastal areas once it is discharged. Prevailing wave action, sand movement, and beach morphodynamics make it difficult to recover spilled nurdles in the ocean and on the coastline. Exposure to nurdles and ingestion of plastic nurdles can potentially induce various health disorders in marine biota.

However, the intrinsic high activity of Li anode, especially to moisture, usually leads to inferior electrochemical performance of Li-O2 battery in humid environments, hindering its widespread application. To settle the trouble of poor moisture tolerance, fabricating a water-proof layer on the Li-metal anode could be an effective tactic. Herein, a facile strategy for constructing an ibuprofen-based protective layer on the Li anode has been proposed to realize highly rechargeable Li-O2 battery in humid atmosphere. Due to the in-situ reaction between ibuprofen reagent and metallic Li, the protective layer with a thickness of ∼30 µm has been uniformly deposited on the surface of Li anode. Particularly, the protective layer, consisting of a large amount of hydrophobic alkyl group and benzene ring, can significantly resist water ingress and enhance the electrochemical stability of Li anode. As a result, the Li-O2 battery based on the protected Li anode achieves a long cycle life of 210 h (21 cycles at 1000 mAh/g, 200 mA/g) in highly moist atmosphere with relative humidity (RH) of 68%.

Specifically, an enhanced sampling method called parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (PaCS-MD) was extended to include flexible docking to construct protein-RNA complexes from those obtained by AI-based modeling (AlphaFold2). With the present technique, the conformational sampling of flexible RNA regions is accelerated by PaCS-MD, enabling one to construct plausible models for protein-RNA complexes. For demonstration, PaCS-MD constructed several protein-RNA complexes of the RNA-binding Musashi-1 (MSI1) family of proteins, which were validated by comparing a group of crucial residues for RNA-binding with experimental complexes. Our analyses suggest that PaCS-MD improves the quality of complex modeling compared to the standard protocol based on template-based modeling (Phyre2). Furthermore, PaCS-MD could also be a beneficial technique for constructing complexes of non-native RNA-binding to proteins.', '© 2023 The Author(s)Electrochemical water splitting to generate oxygen and hydrogen is a key process for several energy storage and conversion devices.

Herein, we report the doping process to prepare two-dimensional Fe-doped NiOOH nanosheets with the tuneable molar ratio of Fe ranging from 0 to 0.4 by using a single-pot synthetic approach. Among the obtained nanomaterials, the Ni0.7Fe0.3OOH nanosheets/C exhibited greatly enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward OER in alkaline media (1.0 M KOH), with an overpotential of 265 mV to afford 10 mA cm−2 current density. The current density produced at fixed overpotential (300 mV) for Ni0.7Fe0.3OOH was 56.5 mA cm−2 which was 22.6, 6.27, 4.18 and 5.13 times higher than those of NiOOH, Ni0.9Fe0.1OOH, Ni0.8Fe0.2OOH and Ni0.6Fe0.4OOH nanosheets /C, respectively. Moreover, the nanosheets were able to retain excellent performance for over 15 h without obvious degradation. The Tafel slope for Ni0.7Fe0.3OOH was 44.8 mV/decade.

The copper catalysts studied in this work ranged from commercially-available copper(II) salts to copper(II) complexes containing polypyridyl ligands. Various factors that affected catalytic activity of copper catalysts were elucidated. It was found that geometry of the copper complex in solution and coordinated anions played important roles in catalytic activity. The copper(II) complex generated in-situ by mixing Cu(OAc)2 and TMPA ligand (TMPA=tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine) adopted trigonal bipyramidal geometry and was competent to catalyze cyclohexane oxidation with higher yields, compared to those of other Cu2+ species used in this work. The optimal catalytic condition was achieved using 1.0 % mol of Cu(OAc)2/TMPA and 10 equivalents of H2O2 with respect to cyclohexane in CH3CN at 33–35 °C for 3 hours, resulting in the total product yield of 44 %. Moreover, since cyclohexyl hydroperoxide was detected as a major product, the Fenton-like mechanism via one electron process was proposed as a plausible mechanism in this cycloalkane oxidation.

However, existing traditional methods like titration are deemed tedious, while the use of sophisticated analytical instruments is not amenable to field testing. Herein, a cyanostilbene-based fluorescent array was rapidly fabricated using macroarray synthesis on a cellulose paper surface to detect amines liberated from spoiled beef, fish, and chicken. The fluorescence changes of immobilized molecules from the interaction with gaseous amines were used to monitor changes in freshness levels. Thanks to the high-throughput nature of macroarray synthesis, a set of highly responsive molecules such as pyridinium and dicyanovinyl moieties were quickly revealed. Importantly, this method offers flexibility in sensing applications including (1) sensing by individual sensor molecules, where the fluorescence response correlated well with established titration methods, and (2) collective sensing whereby chemometric analysis was used to provide a cutoff of freshness with 73–100% accuracy depending on meat types. Overall, this study paves the way for a robust and cost-effective tool for monitoring meat freshness.

AgNPrs were enlarged through a unique mechanism of AgNSs dissolution to silver ions which are subsequently reduced to silver metal by H2O2. Citrate-capping maintains the lateral anisotropic growth by protecting the AgNPrs from oxidation while exposing the sensitive edges to Ostwald ripening. This highly unique process addresses the selectivity issues encountered with decomposition-based AgNSs/NPrs sensors. Absorbance values from the AgNSs decomposition and AgNPrs growth facilitated a more sensitive spectrophotometric assay through ratiometric analysis. Increasing the concentration of the AgNSs/NPrs sensor to 80:40 ppm also improved sensitivity of naked eye detection of H2O2 by generating a wide range of color transitions. Furthermore, selectivity, accuracy and precision evaluation suggest that the dual-shaped silver nanostructure sensor is a potential alternative to H2O2 determination by allowing a simple, rapid, highly selective, and sensitive measurement.', '© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The electro-oxidation of glycerol (EOG) has gained wide attention as an alternative to producing value-added chemicals for glycerol valorization. In this study, a multimetallic electrocatalyst containing copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), tin (Sn), and phosphorus (P) was supported on a carbon catalyzed substrate (CCS) using an electroless deposition technique and evaluated for EOG. The effect of the electroless deposition time (15, 30, and 45 min) was also studied. Characterization of the CuNiSnP/CCS electrocatalyst via X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy revealed the formation of a thin-film morphology containing Cu as the main species on the surface and covering the carbon substrate. The electrochemical performance evaluation showed that the electrocatalyst obtained after 30 min of electroless deposition produced the maximum current density (6.5 mA/cm2). The multimetallic composition of CuNiSnP/CCS provided better reaction performance than related tri- (CuNiP/CCS and NiSnP/CCS), bi- (NiP/CCS), and monometallic (Cu/CCS) composites according to the peak current densities for the forward (if) and backward (ib) oxidation, the if/ib ratio, and the onset potential. Furthermore, CuNiSnP/CCS exhibited more stable and stronger resistance to poisoning. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of the new electrode material CuNiSnP/CCS as an effective electrocatalyst for EOG.

Synthesis and crystallization of the complex has been achieved at ambient conditions using methanol-water (4:1 v/v) as a solvent mixture after very slow evaporation. Furthermore, the complex is characterized by elemental analyses, spectroscopic methods (UV–Visible, FT-IR) and structure elucidation has been carried out by single crystal X-ray structure analyses. X-ray structure determination of the complex revealed the presence of [Cu(H3tea)2]2+ as a cation and two moieties of 3,4-dimethoxycinnamate as anions forming a second sphere coordination complex. Various weak (non-covalent) interactions such as C–H∙∙∙O, and O–H∙∙∙O impart an important role in the lattice stabilization of a second sphere coordination complex. Hirshfeld surface calculations clearly revealed the existence of interplay of non-covalent interactions in lattice stabilization. The theoretical calculation also suggested the total interaction energies in this complex, i.e. 32.6 kj.mol−1. In addition, molecular docking investigations of this complex clearly showed that there is substantial protein-ligand interaction with best binding scores of -7.2, -7.3, -7.9 kcal/mol against 4GKU, 3W4P, 5CGX and -5.8, -7.8 kcal/mol against 4HFZ, 1D5R proteins lesser than parent acid i.e. 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid indicating the potential of this complex; [Cu(H3tea)2](3,4-DMC)2·2H2O as antibacterial and anticancer agent respectively.', '© 2023 American Chemical Society.Human exposure to heavy metals is a concerning global problem because of its detrimental effect on our health and ecosystem. Assessing the levels of these metals is cost- and labor-intensive and nonuser friendly because current analysis approaches typically rely on heavy instrumentations like inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, which is only possible in centralized labs. Hence, simple economical detection methods are in high demand in developing countries and areas with insufficient infrastructure, professional experts, and appropriate environmental treatment. Several microfluidic paper-based analytical devices have been reported as promising alternatives to conventional testing methods for on-site heavy metal detection. Paper-based microfluidics are advantageous because of their simple fabrication, biodegradability, low cost, and ability to operate without pumps. However, typical assay times for current platforms are slow, and they typically rely on pipetting a fixed volume into the assay cards. This adds complexity in actual field scenarios. Here, we report a novel, inexpensive, and straightforward capillary-driven microfluidic device combined with paper for rapid and user-friendly detection of Ni(II), Cu(II), and Fe(III) in water. A colorimetric approach was adopted to quantify these metals. The device was able to produce a homogeneous color signal within 8 s of sample insertion. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were calculated to be 2 and 6.67 ppm for nickel, 0.3 and 1 ppm for Cu, and 1.1 and 3.67 ppm for Fe, respectively. The majority (>90%) of the collected samples showed recovery in the 80-110% range with acceptable accuracy and precision (<15% RSD) for a colorimetric device. This technique can be beneficial for rapidly assessing heavy metal exposure in drinking and surface water at drastically reduced assay time and is the first example of capillary flow-driven microfluidic devices as a transport medium for heavy metal detection.', '© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the development of the development of point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tools because they can serve as useful tools for detecting and controlling spread of the disease. Most current methods require sophisticated laboratory instruments and specialists to provide reliable, cost-effective, specific, and sensitive POC testing for COVID-19 diagnosis. Here, a smartphone-assisted Sensit Smart potentiostat (PalmSens) was integrated with a paper-based electrochemical sensor to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A disposable paper-based device was fabricated, and the working electrode directly modified with a pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA) as the biological recognition element to capture the target complementary DNA (cDNA). In the presence of the target cDNA, hybridization with acpcPNA probe blocks the redox conversion of a redox reporter, leading to a decrease in electrochemical response correlating to SARS-CoV-2 concentration. Under optimal conditions, a linear range from 0.1 to 200 nM and a detection limit of 1.0 pM were obtained. The PNA-based electrochemical paper-based analytical device (PNA-based ePAD) offers high specificity toward SARS-CoV-2 N gene because of the highly selective PNA-DNA binding. The developed sensor was used for amplification-free SARS-CoV-2 detection in 10 nasopharyngeal swab samples (7 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 3 SARS-CoV-2 negative), giving a 100% agreement result with RT-PCR.', '© 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.A mild electrochemical oxidative cyclization for the synthesis of flavones from easy-access 2’-hydroxychalcones was developed using an inexpensive NaI as mediator and electrolyte under ambient temperature in a mixture of EtOH and H2O as solvent. This method was successfully applied to synthesize 26 examples of flavones from a variety of functionalized 2’-hydroxychalcones. A gram-scale formal synthesis of bioactive scutellarein was successfully demonstrated. Control experiments were conducted to disclose a possible indirect oxidation via in situ generation of iodine. The main advantages of this reaction include its broad substrate scope, scalability, ability to operate with benign solvent, and no requirement for strong oxidizing agents and external additives.', '© 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycans are widely expressed on the mammalian cell surfaces and extracellular matrices and play important roles in a variety of cell functions. Studies on the structure-activity relationships of HS have long been hampered by the challenges in obtaining chemically defined HS structures with unique sulfation patterns. Here, we report a new approach to HS glycomimetics based on iterative assembly of clickable disaccharide building blocks that mimic the disaccharide repeating units of native HS. Variably sulfated clickable disaccharides were facilely assembled into a library of mass spec-sequenceable HS-mimetic oligomers with defined sulfation patterns by solution-phase iterative syntheses. Microarray and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assays corroborated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and confirmed that these HS-mimetic oligomers bind protein fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in a sulfation-dependent manner consistent with that of the native HS. This work established a general approach to HS glycomimetics that can potentially serve as alternatives to native HS in both fundamental research and disease models.', '© 2023 American Chemical Society.A multiloop splitter-based non-cryogenic artificial trapping (M-SNAT) modulation technique was established, which applied the first (1D) nonpolar and the second (2D) polar columns, deactivated fused silica (DFS) columns, a microfluidic Deans switch (DS), and splitters located between the 1D column outlet and the DS. The splitters were connected into multiple loops with a progressively doubled perimeter of the next loop. This enabled a duplex splitting mechanism within each loop consisting of splitting of analyte pulses, the pulse delay, and their combination which led to equally split peaks of the same analytes with the number of split peaks (nsplit) equal to 2m (m = number of loops). This system resulted in local profiles of artificially split-and-trapped analytes prior to their selective transfers onto the 2D column by means of periodic multiple heart-cuts (H/C). The developed SNAT approach can be successful, providing that the ratio of modulation period to sampling time (PM/tsamp) is equal to nsplit. The approach with nsplit = 16 was further developed into a single device platform and applied for the modulation of a wide range of compounds in waste tire pyrolysis samples with the RSD of ≤0.01 and <10% for the one-dimensional modulated peak times and peak areas, respectively (n = 50). The method enabled an artificial modulation mechanism without cryogen consumption and enhanced the 2D peak capacity (2nc) and 2D separation by use of a longer 2D column.', \"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A selective and sensitive procedure for the trace analysis of atrazine (ATZ) in surface water samples was developed using the semi-automated solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with a colorimetric method. In this work, we developed Konig's reaction using p-anisidine as a new coupling agent to form a red-colored dye product having λmax 500 nm and tuned the reaction conditions to occur at 40 °C. The possible structure of the orange-red dye product was proposed based on HPLC-UV and UPLC-MS analyses. Under the optimized conditions, the method provided linearity range of 10–30 µg/L with a good coefficient of determination (R2 > 0.99) in different sample matrices. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were 2.49 and 7.54 µg/L, respectively. The method validity was evaluated by analyzing the ATZ spiked samples collected from paddy fields, fish farms, and natural canal waters with a recovery range of 104–119 %, and the results were in good agreement with those obtained using HPLC-UV. The developed method was able to reduce the requirement of high heating temperature for the conventional Konig's reaction and was expected to be used for the practical analysis of ATZ at the ppb levels in natural water.\", '© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Nitrosamine impurities in pharmaceuticals have recently been concerned for several national regulatory agencies to avoid carcinogenic and mutagenic effects in patients. The demand for highly sensitive and specific analytical methods with LOQs in the ppb and sub-ppb ranges is among the most significant challenges facing analytical scientists. In addition, artifactual nitrosamine formation during sample preparation and injection leading to overestimation of nitrosamines has received considerable attention. Numerous analytical methodologies have been reported for quantifying nitrosamine impurities in active pharmaceutical ingredients and medicinal products at the interim limit criteria as preventive measures. In this review, we meticulously discuss those reported gas and liquid chromatographic methods for nitrosamine determination in pharmaceuticals in aspects of chromatographic conditions and sensitivity of detection. We also introduce the potential of novel fluorescence-based methods recently developed to rapidly screen nitrosamine impurities. In addition, the review assesses the nitrosation assay procedure (NAP test), which is expected to be a future preventive measure for screening potential nitrosation and identifying suspected contamination with N-nitroso or other potential mutagenic impurities during the drug development process.', '© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Weedy rice is one of the most problematic weeds in rice-growing regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Unlike other types of weeds, it is extremely difficult to distinguish weedy rice from cultivated rice directly from paddy seeds as they exhibit common morphological features. As such weed management can be a difficult, time-consuming, and inaccurate process that is often carried out manually. This study offers a novel classification approach based on an artificial neural network (ANN), utilizing self-organizing maps (SOMs), to directly discriminate weedy rice using the near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technique. The physical attributes, thermal behavior, and chemical profiles of the weedy and cultivated rice were thoroughly investigated by a range of analytical techniques, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and direct analysis in real-time mass spectrometry (DART-MS). For direct sample analysis by HSI, a global self-organizing map was generated with optimized parameters (scaling value and map size). The color indices (Red, Green, Blue values) of the sample image were defined to obtain a color ratio that can be used to classify unknown samples. The optimal threshold for classification was carefully determined using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, and misclassification error) were used to evaluate the performance of the model. Classification accuracies of 98% (Weedy vs PL2) and 88% (Weedy vs RD49) were obtained with balanced sensitivity and specificity. The classification was assessed from the whole sample image, which was completely independent of the selected region of interest. As far as we know, this is the first instance where SOMs have been utilized to appraise seed quality by means of authentic HSI images.', '© 20223D printing technologies are an attractive for fabricating electrochemical sensors due to their ease of operation, freedom of design, fast prototyping, low waste, and low cost. We report the fabrication of a simple 3D-printed electrochemical sensing device for non-enzymatic detection of creatinine, an important indicator of renal function. To create the 3D-printed electrodes (3DE), carbon black/polylactic acid (CB/PLA) composite filament was used. The 3DE was activated using 0.5 M NaOH via amperometry prior to use to improve electrochemical performance. To give selectivity for creatinine, the activated 3DE was modified with a copper oxide nanoparticle-ionic liquid/reduced graphene oxide (CuO-IL/rGO) composite. The modified 3DE was characterized using microscopy and electrochemistry. Cyclic voltammetry and amperometry were used to evaluate sensor performance. The modified 3DE provided electrocatalytic activity towards creatinine without enzymes. Under optimal conditions, the modified 3DE directly coupled with a portable smartphone potentiostat exhibited the linear detection range of 0.5–35.0 mM, and the limit of detection was 37.3 μM, which is sufficient for detecting creatinine in human urine samples. Furthermore, the other physiological compounds present in human urine were not detected on the modified 3DE. Therefore, the modified 3DE could be a tool for effective creatinine screening in the urine.', '© 2023 American Chemical Society.The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a significant health issue globally. Point-of-care (POC) testing that can offer a rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 at the early stage of infection is highly desirable to constrain this outbreak, especially in resource-limited settings. Herein, we present a G-quadruplex DNAzyme-based electrochemical assay that is integrated with a sequential flow controllable microfluidic device for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 cDNA. According to the detection principle, a pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid probe is immobilized on a screen-printed graphene electrode for capturing SARS-CoV-2 DNA. The captured DNA subsequently hybridizes with another DNA probe that carries a G-quadruplex DNAzyme as the signaling unit. The G-quadruplex DNAzyme catalyzes the H2O2-mediated oxidation of hydroquinone to benzoquinone that can be detected using square-wave voltammetry to give a signal that corresponds to the target DNA concentration. The assay exhibited high selectivity for SARS-CoV-2 DNA and showed a good experimental detection limit at 30 pM. To enable automation, the DNAzyme-based assay was combined with a capillary-driven microfluidic device featuring a burst valve technology to allow sequential sample and reagent delivery as well as the DNA target hybridization and enzymatic reaction to be operated in a precisely controlled fashion. The developed microfluidic device was successfully applied for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swab samples. The results were in good agreement with the standard RT-PCR method and could be performed within 20 min. Thus, this platform offers desirable characteristics that make it an alternative POC tool for COVID-19 diagnosis.', '© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.Sepsis, an infectious disease affecting millions of people’s health worldwide each year, calls for urgent attention to an improvement of analytical devices. Chemiluminescence immunoassay is a typical diagnostic method utilized to assess the risk development of sepsis. However, due to its high-cost, delayed, and complicated procedure, the practical utilization is therefore undoubtedly limited, especially for point-of-care test. Herein, we fabricated for the first time an immunosensor based on dendritic copper nanostructures (CuNSs) combined with 4-aminobenzoic acid (4-AB, the diazonium salt) as antibody linker modified on a screen-printed graphene electrode for the early detection of the sepsis biomarker interleukin-6 (IL-6). The electrode fabrication is made by electrodeposition, thus eliminating the multistep of nanomaterial synthesis and time wasting. The resulting dendritic CuNSs significantly increase the effective surface area (1.2 times) and the sensor’s performance. The morphology of this combination was characterized using CV, EIS, SEM, EDX, and FTIR techniques. In the detection process, the appearance of IL-6 suppresses the current response of the redox probe indicator measured by differential pulse voltammetry due to the antibody-antigen complex. The subtraction of signal (ΔI) was interpreted as IL-6 concentration. This sensor exhibited a linear range from 0.05 to 500 pg mL−1 with low detection limit of 0.02 pg mL−1, proving a possibility for early sepsis screening. In addition, the established immunosensor can successfully quantify IL-6 in human serum sample, in which the results agreed well with those achieved using the standard approach, further showing high practical applicability of this developed immunosensor.

Electroanalysis published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.To move electrochemical sensing technology from the laboratory into point-of-care (POC)-based settings, electrochemical platforms must be cost-effective, portable, and user-friendly. Here, we present the comparison of a near-field communication (NFC) potentiostat with a traditional potentiostat. The NFC potentiostat is roughly the size of a credit card and is wirelessly powered by a smartphone with a user-friendly application for electrochemical analysis. The proposed system is portable, affordable, and provides analytical capabilities comparable to traditional benchtop potentiostats. Different redox probes were investigated, including ferricyanide, ruthenium hexamine, and hydroquinone, highlighting the ability of the NFC potentiostat to measure a variety of target analytes. In addition, the NFC potentiostat can perform several electrochemical techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, chronoamperometry and square wave voltammetry. The combination of affordable screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE)s with the portable, inexpensive NFC potentiostat highlights this platform‘s promise towards POC electrochemical sensing applications, particularly for medical diagnostics in rural or low-income areas.']\n"
